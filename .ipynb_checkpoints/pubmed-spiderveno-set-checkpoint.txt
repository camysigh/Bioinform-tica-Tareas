AB  - Calommata signata, a burrowing spider, represents a special type of predation mode 
      in spiders, and its utilization of toxins is different from that of web-weaving 
      spiders and wandering spiders. The existing researches on spider toxins are mainly 
      focused on the web-weaving and wandering spiders, but little attention on that of 
      the burrowing spiders. Through transcriptome sequencing of C. signata venom gland 
      and the remaining part as the counterpart tissue, 25 putative neurotoxin precursors 
      were identified. These most neurotoxins were novel because their low similarities 
      with the known sequences except for that of over 50% similarities in four 
      neuropeptide toxins. The 25 neuropeptide toxins were divided into five families 
      according to the constitution of cysteines for the possible disulfide bonds and the 
      similarities of the deduced amino acid sequences. Besides neuropeptide toxins, other 
      potential toxins in the venom gland were also analyzed. Unlike web-weaving spiders 
      and wandering spiders, only a few neurotoxin genes were significantly expressed in 
      the venom gland of C. signata. In the non-peptide toxin genes, only CsTryp_SPc-1, 
      CsPA2-1, CsVa5-2 and four PDI genes were abundantly expressed in the venom gland. 
      The present study provided an improved understanding on the spider toxin diversity 
      and useful information for the exploitation of spider toxins.

AB  - Analysis of spider venom gland transcriptomes focuses on the identification of 
      possible neurotoxins, proteins and enzymes. Here, the first comprehensive 
      transcriptome analysis of cupiennins, small linear cationic peptides, also known as 
      cytolytic or antimicrobial peptides, is reported from the venom gland transcriptome 
      of Cupiennius salei by 454- and Illumina 3000 sequencing. Four transcript families 
      with complex precursor structures are responsible for the expression of 179 linear 
      peptides. Within the transcript families, after an anionic propeptide, cationic 
      linear peptides are separated by anionic linkers, which are transcript family 
      specific. The C-terminus of the transcript families is characterized by a linear 
      peptide or truncated linkers with unknown function. A new identified 
      posttranslational processing mechanism explains the presence of the two-chain 
      CsTx-16 family in the venom. The high diversity of linear peptides in the venom of a 
      spider and this unique synthesis process is at least genus specific as verified with 
      Cupiennius getazi.

TI  - Transcriptomic Analysis of the Spider Venom Gland Reveals Venom Diversity and 
      Species Consanguinity.
LID - 10.3390/toxins11020068 [doi]
LID - 68
AB  - Selenocosmia jiafu (S. jiafu) has been recently identified as a new species of 
      spider in China. It lives in the same habitat as various other venomous spiders, 
      including Chilobrachys jingzhao (C. jingzhao), Selenocosmia huwena (S. huwena), and 
      Macrothele raveni (M. raveni). The venom from these different species of spiders 
      exhibits some similarities and some differences in terms of their biochemical and 
      electrophysiological properties. With the objective to illustrate the diversity in 
      venom peptide toxins and to establish the evolutionary relationship between 
      different spider species, we first performed transcriptomic analysis on a cDNA 
      library from the venom gland of S. jiafu. We identified 146 novel toxin-like 
      sequences, which were classified into eighteen different superfamilies. This 
      transcriptome was then compared with that of C. jingzhao, which revealed that the 
      putative toxins from both spider venoms may have originated from the same ancestor, 
      although novel toxins evolved independently in the two species. A BLAST search and 
      pharmacological analysis revealed that the two venoms have similar sodium channel 
      modulation activity. This study provides insights into the venom of two closely 
      related species of spider, which will prove useful towards understanding the 
      structure and function of their toxins.

TI  - Analysis of High Molecular Mass Compounds from the Spider Pamphobeteus verdolaga 
      Venom Gland. A Transcriptomic and MS ID Approach.
LID - 10.3390/toxins13070453 [doi]
LID - 453
AB  - Nowadays, spider venom research focuses on the neurotoxic activity of small 
      peptides. In this study, we investigated high-molecular-mass compounds that have 
      either enzymatic activity or housekeeping functions present in either the venom 
      gland or venom of Pamphobeteus verdolaga. We used proteomic and 
      transcriptomic-assisted approaches to recognize the proteins sequences related to 
      high-molecular-mass compounds present in either venom gland or venom. We report the 
      amino acid sequences (partial or complete) of 45 high-molecular-mass compounds 
      detected by transcriptomics showing similarity to other proteins with either 
      enzymatic activity (i.e., phospholipases A(2), kunitz-type, hyaluronidases, and 
      sphingomyelinase D) or housekeeping functions involved in the signaling process, 
      glucanotransferase function, and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. MS/MS 
      analysis showed fragments exhibiting a resemblance similarity with different 
      sequences detected by transcriptomics corresponding to sphingomyelinase D, 
      hyaluronidase, lycotoxins, cysteine-rich secretory proteins, and kunitz-type serine 
      protease inhibitors, among others. Additionally, we report a probably new protein 
      sequence corresponding to the lycotoxin family detected by transcriptomics. The 
      phylogeny analysis suggested that P. verdolaga includes a basal protein that 
      underwent a duplication event that gave origin to the lycotoxin proteins reported 
      for Lycosa sp. This approach allows proposing an evolutionary relationship of 
      high-molecular-mass proteins among P. verdolaga and other spider species.

      and Proteomic Analyses.
LID - 10.3390/toxins11100611 [doi]
LID - 611
AB  - This review gives an overview on the development of research on spider venoms with a 
      focus on structure and function of venom components and techniques of analysis. 
      Major venom component groups are small molecular mass compounds, antimicrobial (also 
      called cytolytic, or cationic) peptides (only in some spider families), 
      cysteine-rich (neurotoxic) peptides, and enzymes and proteins. Cysteine-rich 
      peptides are reviewed with respect to various structural motifs, their targets (ion 
      channels, membrane receptors), nomenclature, and molecular binding. We further 
      describe the latest findings concerning the maturation of antimicrobial, and 
      cysteine-rich peptides that are in most known cases expressed as 
      propeptide-containing precursors. Today, venom research, increasingly employs 
      transcriptomic and mass spectrometric techniques. Pros and cons of venom gland 
      transcriptome analysis with Sanger, 454, and Illumina sequencing are discussed and 
      an overview on so far published transcriptome studies is given. In this respect, we 
      also discuss the only recently described cross contamination arising from 
      multiplexing in Illumina sequencing and its possible impacts on venom studies. High 
      throughput mass spectrometric analysis of venom proteomes (bottom-up, top-down) are 
      reviewed.

TI  - Venom gland size and venom complexity-essential trophic adaptations of venomous 
      predators: A case study using spiders.
PG  - 4257-4269

AB  - Specialized predators possess a variety of adaptations. In venomous predators, this 
      may include the size of the venom gland and venom composition. It is expected that 
      due to different foraging strategies, predators with a wide trophic niche 
      (generalists) should possess larger venom glands that contain more diversified 
      components than predators with a narrow niche (specialists). We focused on spiders, 
      as the most diversified group of venomous predators, in which a wide variety of 
      trophic strategies have evolved. We conducted a comparative analysis using 40 spider 
      species, in which we measured the size of their venom gland and venom complexity 
      using proteome profiling methods. The species were classified into three trophic 
      groups: generalists, facultative specialists and obligatory specialists. We found 
      that the venom glands of generalists are larger than those of obligatory 
      specialists, which is presumably due to more frequent prey capture by the former. 
      The complexity of venom of peptides (2-15 kDa) and proteins (15-250 kDa) was more 
      diverse in generalists than in specialists. Multivariate analysis of venom revealed 
      significant differences among the three trophic categories only in the complexity of 
      peptides. Our study thus shows that venom gland size and its content have taken 
      different pathways during the evolution of different trophic strategies in spiders. 
      Generalists evolved larger venom glands with more complex composition, whereas 
      obligatory specialists possess smaller glands with less diverse chemical structures.

AB  - Merely touching the pancreas can lead to premature zymogen activation and 
      pancreatitis but the mechanism is not completely understood. Here we demonstrate 
      that pancreatic acinar cells express the mechanoreceptor Piezo1 and application of 
      pressure within the gland produces pancreatitis. To determine if this effect is 
      through Piezo1 activation, we induce pancreatitis by intrapancreatic duct 
      instillation of the Piezo1 agonist Yoda1. Pancreatitis induced by pressure within 
      the gland is prevented by a Piezo1 antagonist. In pancreatic acinar cells, Yoda1 
      stimulates calcium influx and induces calcium-dependent pancreatic injury. Finally, 
      selective acinar cell-specific genetic deletion of Piezo1 protects mice against 
      pressure-induced pancreatitis. Thus, activation of Piezo1 in pancreatic acinar cells 
      is a mechanism for pancreatitis and may explain why pancreatitis develops following 
      pressure on the gland as in abdominal trauma, pancreatic duct obstruction, 
      pancreatography, or pancreatic surgery. Piezo1 blockade may prevent pancreatitis 
      when manipulation of the gland is anticipated.

TI  - Proteotranscriptomic Insights into the Venom Composition of the Wolf Spider Lycosa 
      tarantula.
LID - 10.3390/toxins12080501 [doi]
LID - 501
AB  - Spider venoms represent an original source of novel compounds with therapeutic and 
      agrochemical potential. Whereas most of the research efforts have focused on large 
      mygalomorph spiders, araneomorph spiders are equally promising but require more 
      sensitive and sophisticated approaches given their limited size and reduced venom 
      yield. Belonging to the latter group, the genus Lycosa ("wolf spiders") contains 
      many species widely distributed throughout the world. These spiders are ambush 
      predators that do not build webs but instead rely strongly on their venom for prey 
      capture. Lycosa tarantula is one of the largest species of wolf spider, but its 
      venom composition is unknown. Using a combination of RNA sequencing of the venom 
      glands and venom proteomics, we provide the first overview of the peptides and 
      proteins produced by this iconic Mediterranean spider. Beside the typical small 
      disulfide rich neurotoxins, several families of proteins were also identified, 
      including cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP) and Hyaluronidases. Proteomic 
      analysis of the electrically stimulated venom validated 30 of these transcriptomic 
      sequences, including nine putative neurotoxins and eight venom proteins. 
      Interestingly, LC-MS venom profiles of manual versus electric stimulation, as well 
      as female versus male, showed some marked differences in mass distribution. Finally, 
      we also present some preliminary data on the biological activity of L. tarantula 
      crude venom.

AB  - Venoms are chemically complex secretions typically comprising numerous proteins and 
      peptides with varied physiological activities. Functional characterization of venom 
      proteins has important biomedical applications, including the identification of drug 
      leads or probes for cellular receptors. Spiders are the most species rich clade of 
      venomous organisms, but the venoms of only a few species are well-understood, in 
      part due to the difficulty associated with collecting minute quantities of venom 
      from small animals. This paper presents a protocol for the collection of venom from 
      spiders using electrical stimulation, demonstrating the procedure on the Western 
      black widow (Latrodectus hesperus). The collected venom is useful for varied 
      downstream analyses including direct protein identification via mass spectrometry, 
      functional assays, and stimulation of venom gene expression for transcriptomic 
      studies. This technique has the advantage over protocols that isolate venom from 
      whole gland homogenates, which do not separate genuine venom components from 
      cellular proteins that are not secreted as part of the venom. Representative results 
      demonstrate the detection of known venom peptides from the collected sample using 
      mass spectrometry. The venom collection procedure is followed by a protocol for 
      dissecting spider venom glands, with results demonstrating that this leads to the 
      characterization of venom-expressed proteins and peptides at the sequence level.

TI  - Identification and characterization of toxins in the venom gland of the Chinese bird 
      spider, Haplopelma hainanum, by transcriptomic analysis.
PG  - 487-99

AB  - Tarantula venoms provide a model system for studying toxin selectivity, 
      structure-activity relationships and molecular evolution of peptide toxins. Previous 
      studies have identified a large number of peptide toxins in the venom of the Chinese 
      bird spider Haplopelma hainanum, generally regarded as a highly venomous spider. 
      However, the lack of available RNA-seq transcriptomic and genomic data is an 
      obstacle to understanding its venom at the molecular level. In this study, we 
      investigated the venom gland transcriptome of H. hainanum by RNA-seq, in the absence 
      of an available genomic sequence. We identified 201 potential toxins among 57 181 de 
      novo assembled transcripts, including knottins, Kunitz-type toxins, enzymes and 
      other proteins. We systematically identified most of the knottins and Kunitz-type 
      toxins, some of which showed strongly biased expression in the venom gland, 
      including members of the huwentoxin-1, huwentoxin-2 and magi-1 families. We also 
      discovered several novel potential toxins. These data demonstrate the high molecular 
      and structural diversity in the venom toxins of H. hainanum. This study offers a 
      useful strategy for exploring the complex components of spider venoms.

AB  - A comprehensive transcriptome analysis of an expressed sequence tag (EST) database 
      of the spider Dolomedes fimbriatus venom glands using single-residue distribution 
      analysis (SRDA) identified 7,169 unique sequences. Mature chains of 163 different 
      toxin-like polypeptides were predicted on the basis of well-established methodology. 
      The number of protein precursors of these polypeptides was appreciably numerous than 
      the number of mature polypeptides. A total of 451 different polypeptide precursors, 
      translated from 795 unique nucleotide sequences, were deduced. A homology search 
      divided the 163 mature polypeptide sequences into 16 superfamilies and 19 
      singletons. The number of mature toxins in a superfamily ranged from 2 to 49, 
      whereas the diversity of the original nucleotide sequences was greater (2-261 
      variants). We observed a predominance of inhibitor cysteine knot toxin-like 
      polypeptides among the cysteine-containing structures in the analyzed transcriptome 
      bank. Uncommon spatial folds were also found.

TI  - Alternative Transcription at Venom Genes and Its Role as a Complementary Mechanism 
      for the Generation of Venom Complexity in the Common House Spider.
LID - 85 [pii]
LID - 10.3389/fevo.2019.00085 [doi]
AB  - The complex composition of venom, a proteinaceous secretion used by diverse animal 
      groups for predation or defense, is typically viewed as being driven by gene 
      duplication in conjunction with positive selection, leading to large families of 
      diversified toxins with selective venom gland expression. Yet, the production of 
      alternative transcripts at venom genes is often overlooked as another potentially 
      important process that could contribute proteins to venom, and requires 
      comprehensive datasets integrating genome and transcriptome sequences together with 
      proteomic characterization of venom to be fully documented. In the common house 
      spider, Parasteatoda tepidariorum, we used RNA sequencing of four tissue types in 
      conjunction with the sequenced genome to provide a comprehensive transcriptome 
      annotation. We also used mass spectrometry to identify a minimum of 99 distinct 
      proteins in P tepidariorum venom, including at least 33 latrotoxins, pore-forming 
      neurotoxins shared with the confamilial black widow. We found that venom proteins 
      are much more likely to come from multiple transcript genes, whose transcripts 
      produced distinct protein sequences. The presence of multiple distinct proteins in 
      venom from transcripts at individual genes was confirmed for eight loci by mass 
      spectrometry, and is possible at 21 others. Alternative transcripts from the same 
      gene, whether encoding or not encoding a protein found in venom, showed a range of 
      expression patterns, but were not necessarily restricted to the venom gland. 
      However, approximately half of venom protein encoding transcripts were found among 
      the 1,318 transcripts with strongly venom gland biased expression. Our findings 
      revealed an important role for alternative transcription in generating venom protein 
      complexity and expanded the traditional model of venom evolution.

AB  - Latrodectus tredecimguttatus, commonly known as black widow spider, is well known 
      for its dangerous bite. Although its venom has been characterized extensively, some 
      fundamental questions about its molecular composition remain unanswered. The limited 
      transcriptome and genome data available prevent further understanding of spider 
      venom at the molecular level. In the present study, we combined next-generation 
      sequencing and conventional DNA sequencing to construct a venom gland transcriptome 
      of the spider L. tredecimguttatus, which resulted in the identification of 9,666 and 
      480 high-confidence proteins among 34,334 de novo sequences and 1,024 cDNA 
      sequences, respectively, by assembly, translation, filtering, quantification and 
      annotation. Extensive functional analyses of these proteins indicated that mRNAs 
      involved in RNA transport and spliceosome, protein translation, processing and 
      transport were highly enriched in the venom gland, which is consistent with the 
      specific function of venom glands, namely the production of toxins. Furthermore, we 
      identified 146 toxin-like proteins forming 12 families, including 6 new families in 
      this spider in which α-LTX-Lt1a family2 is firstly identified as a subfamily of 
      α-LTX-Lt1a family. The toxins were classified according to their bioactivities into 
      five categories that functioned in a coordinate way. Few ion channels were expressed 
      in venom gland cells, suggesting a possible mechanism of protection from the attack 
      of their own toxins. The present study provides a gland transcriptome profile and 
      extends our understanding of the toxinome of spiders and coordination mechanism for 
      toxin production in protein expression quantity.

AB  - The spider venom is a large pharmacological repertoire composed of different types 
      of bioactive peptide toxins. Despite the importance of spider toxins in capturing 
      terrestrial prey and defending themselves against predators, we know little about 
      the venom components from the spider acting on the fish. Here we constructed a cDNA 
      library of a pair of venomous glands from a single fish-hunting spider Dolomedes 
      mizhoanus. A total of 356 high-quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained 
      from the venom gland cDNA library and analyzed. These transcripts were further 
      classified into 45 clusters (19 contigs and 26 singletons), most of which encoded 
      cystine knot toxins (CKTs) and non-CKTs. The ESTs coding for 53 novel CKT precursors 
      were abundant transcripts in the venom glands of the spider D. mizhoanus, accounting 
      for 76% of the total ESTs, the precursors of which were grouped into six families 
      based on the sequence identity and the phylogenetic analysis. In addition, the 
      non-CKTs deduced from 21% of the total ESTs were annotated by Gene Ontology terms 
      and eukaryotic orthologous groups. Fifty-five CKT precursors deduced from 273 ESTs 
      are the largest dataset for a single spider specimen to date. The results may 
      contribute to discovering novel potential drug leads from spider venoms and a better 
      understanding of the evolutionary relationship of the spider toxin.

AB  - The multicomponent venom of the spider Cupiennius salei was separated by three 
      different chromatographic strategies to facilitate subsequent analysis of peptidic 
      venom components by tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS and ESI-MS), Edman 
      degradation and amino acid analysis: (a) desalting of the crude venom by RP-HPLC 
      only, (b) chromatographic separation of the crude venom into 42 fractions by 
      RP-HPLC, and (c) multidimensional purification of the crude venom by size exclusion 
      and cation exchange chromatography and RP-HPLC. A total of 286 components were 
      identified in the venom of C. salei by mass spectrometry and the sequence of 49 new 
      peptides was determined de novo by Edman degradation and tandem mass spectrometry; 
      30 were C-terminally amidated. The novel peptides were assigned to two main groups: 
      (a) short cationic peptides and (b) Cys-containing peptides with the inhibitor 
      cystine knot motif. Bioinformatics revealed a limited number of substantial 
      similarities, namely with the peptides CpTx1 from the spider 
      Cheiracantium punctorium and U3-ctenitoxin-Asp1a from the South American fishing 
      spider (Ancylometes sp.) and with sequences from a Lycosa singoriensis venom gland 
      transcriptome analysis. The results clearly indicate that the quality of the data is 
      strongly dependent on the chosen separation strategy. The combination of orthogonal 
      analytical methods efficiently excludes alkali ion and matrix adducts, provides 
      indispensable information for an unambiguous identification of isomasses, and 
      results in the most comprehensive repertoire of peptides identified in the venom of 
      C. salei so far.

AB  - The pond wolf spider, Pardosa pseudoannulata, is one of the most dominant predators 
      of several agriculture insect pests including mainly the rice planthoppers and 
      leafhoppers in paddy fields in Asia. Venom has been an attractive subject as the 
      powerful weapon of spiders due to the complex components secreted from venom gland. 
      The transcriptome of P. pseudoannulata venom gland was sequenced in order to 
      understand the diversity of venom components at the molecular level and provide a 
      new perspective for insect pest management. A total of 48 potential peptide toxins 
      were identified from 75,980 assembled transcripts. Among them, 32 putative 
      neurotoxin precursors were classified into six families systematically. In addition 
      to neurotoxins, peptide toxins with potential antiviral and antifungal activities 
      were annotated as well as the protease inhibitors. The diversity of P. 
      pseudoannulata venom was firmly demonstrated with the presence of astacin-like 
      metalloprotease toxins, Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors, venom allergen 5, 
      hyaluronidase and other important venom components. In addition, the tissue 
      expression profiles of the toxin-related genes were investigated in venom gland, 
      brain, and fat body. The present study classified the diverse venom components P. 
      pseudoannulata and provided essential information of potential insecticidal toxins 
      for the biological control of insect pests.

TI  - Venom and Antivenom of the Redback Spider (Latrodectus hasseltii) in Japan. Part I. 
      Venom Extraction, Preparation, and Laboratory Testing.
PG  - 116-121
LID - 10.7883/yoken.JJID.2017.291 [doi]
AB  - The redback spider (Latrodectus hasseltii Thorell) reportedly invaded Japan in 
      September 1995. To date, 84 redback spider bite cases have been reported; 7 of these 
      cases employed the antivenom. Antivenom has been imported from Australia in the 
      past, but because of restrictions on exportation it was evident that nearly all of 
      the antivenom present in Japan would expire during 2014. In 2014, a plan was 
      proposed to experimentally manufacture and stockpile a horse antiserum for 
      ourselves, using redback spiders indigenous to Japan. A total of 11,403 female 
      spiders were captured alive: 1,217 from the vicinity of Nishinomiya City, Hyogo 
      prefecture, and 10,186 from Osaka prefecture. Of these, 10,007 females were 
      dissected, and the venom was extracted from the venom glands of individuals and 
      subjected to crude purification to yield 4 lots, of which the majority was 
      α-latrotoxin. Among them, a large amount of single lots with an estimated protein 
      content of 236 mg is subsequently scheduled to be used for immunizing horses. We 
      also determined lethal toxicity of the venom (LD(50): 9.17 μg per mouse), and 
      established the assay for the determination of an anti-lethal titer of antivenom in 
      mice.

TI  - New Insectotoxin from Tibellus Oblongus Spider Venom Presents Novel Adaptation of 
      ICK Fold.
LID - 10.3390/toxins13010029 [doi]
LID - 29
AB  - The Tibellus oblongus spider is an active predator that does not spin webs and 
      remains poorly investigated in terms of venom composition. Here, we present a new 
      toxin, named Tbo-IT2, predicted by cDNA analysis of venom glands transcriptome. The 
      presence of Tbo-IT2 in the venom was confirmed by proteomic analyses using the LC-MS 
      and MS/MS techniques. The distinctive features of Tbo-IT2 are the low similarity of 
      primary structure with known animal toxins and the unusual motif of 10 cysteine 
      residues distribution. Recombinant Tbo-IT2 (rTbo-IT2), produced in E. coli using the 
      thioredoxin fusion protein strategy, was structurally and functionally studied. 
      rTbo-IT2 showed insecticidal activity on larvae of the housefly Musca domestica 
      (LD(100) 200 μg/g) and no activity on the panel of expressed neuronal receptors and 
      ion channels. The spatial structure of the peptide was determined in a water 
      solution by NMR spectroscopy. The Tbo-IT2 structure is a new example of evolutionary 
      adaptation of a well-known inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) fold to 5 disulfide bonds 
      configuration, which determines additional conformational stability and gives 
      opportunities for insectotoxicity and probably some other interesting features.

AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom has been studied for more than 40 years and 
      several components with pharmacological potential have been described in it. 
      However, studies on venoms from other species of the Phoneutria genus are scarce. In 
      this work, a conventional cDNA library from the species Phoneutria pertyi venom 
      glands was constructed, aiming to identify novel putative cysteine-rich peptide 
      toxins for the genus Phoneutria. 296 unique sequences were identified and 51 
      sequences corresponded to putative cysteine-rich peptide toxins. Besides 
      cysteine-rich peptide toxins, other putative venom components such as protease 
      inhibitors, defensins and serine proteinases were identified. Furthermore, by manual 
      curation of the sequences with no match at UniProt, we were able to identify 
      glycine-rich proteins (GRP), a class of venom component never described in 
      Phoneutria genus. This work describes the first complete sequences of toxins from 
      the venom of P. pertyi and reveals that, despite most of the retrieved toxins show a 
      high identity to toxins identified in Phoneutria genus, novel putative toxins 
      remains to be described.

AB  - The brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus, is a predator of a variety of 
      agricultural insects and is also hazardous for humans. Its venom is a true 
      pharmacopeia representing neurotoxic peptides targeting the ion channels and/or 
      receptors of both vertebrates and invertebrates. The lack of transcriptomic 
      information, however, limits our knowledge of the diversity of components present in 
      its venom. The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) carry out a transcriptomic 
      analysis of the venom, and (2) investigate the bioactivity of the venom using an 
      electrophysiological bioassay. From 32,505 assembled transcripts, 8 toxin families 
      were classified, and the ankyrin repeats (ANK), agatoxin, centipede toxin, 
      ctenitoxin, lycotoxin, scorpion toxin-like, and SCP families were reported in the L. 
      geometricus venom gland. The diversity of L. geometricus venom was also uncovered by 
      the transcriptomics approach with the presence of defensins, chitinases, 
      translationally controlled tumor proteins (TCTPs), leucine-rich proteins, serine 
      proteases, and other important venom components. The venom was also 
      chromatographically purified, and the activity contained in the fractions was 
      investigated using an electrophysiological bioassay with the use of a voltage clamp 
      on ion channels in order to find if the neurotoxic effects of the spider venom could 
      be linked to a particular molecular target. The findings show that 
      U24-ctenitoxin-Pn1a involves the inhibition of the insect sodium (Na(v)) channels, 
      BgNa(v) and DmNa(v). This study provides an overview of the molecular diversity of 
      L. geometricus venom, which can be used as a reference for the venom of other spider 
      species. The venom composition profile also increases our knowledge for the 
      development of novel insecticides targeting voltage-gated sodium channels.

TI  - Morphological Analysis Reveals a Compartmentalized Duct in the Venom Apparatus of 
      the Wasp Spider (Argiope bruennichi).

AB  - Spiders are one of the most successful groups of venomous animals, but surprisingly 
      few species have been examined in sufficient detail to determine the structure of 
      their venom systems. To learn more about the venom system of the family Araneidae 
      (orb-weavers), we selected the wasp spider (Argiope bruennichi) and examined the 
      general structure and morphology of the venom apparatus by light microscopy. This 
      revealed morphological features broadly similar to those reported in the small 
      number of other spiders subject to similar investigations. However, detailed 
      evaluation of the venom duct revealed the presence of four structurally distinct 
      compartments. We propose that these subunits facilitate the expression and secretion 
      of venom components, as previously reported for similar substructures in pit vipers 
      and cone snails.

AB  - Lycosa vittata, mainly distributed in the southwest of China, is a medium-sized and 
      venomous spider, whose venom remains unexplored so far. This study aims to present 
      an overview of the venom. It mainly consisted of diverse peptides and exhibited 
      inhibitory effects on voltage-gated ion channels in rat dorsal root ganglia neurons, 
      with a strongest inhibition on tetrodotoxin-sensitive and tetrodotoxin-resistant 
      voltage-gated Na(+) channels. Interestingly, it exerted cytotoxicity to cancer 
      cells, with approximately 10-fold selectivity on PC-3 over others, implying the 
      existence of selective anti-PC-3 agents in the venom. Moreover, 51 toxin-like 
      peptides were deduced from the venom gland transcriptome. Bioinformatic analyses 
      suggested their structures might have some distinguished properties and their 
      predicted functions were consistent with the venom activities. This study suggests 
      that the venom is an attractive source of neurotoxins with therapeutic significance, 
      and provides references for the structure and function investigation of specific 
      toxins in the future.

TI  - Origin and Characterization of Extracellular Vesicles Present in the Spider Venom of 
      Ornithoctonus hainana.
LID - 10.3390/toxins13080579 [doi]
LID - 579
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are membranous 
      vesicles released from nearly all cellular types. They contain various bioactive 
      molecules, and their molecular composition varies depending on their cellular 
      origin. As research into venomous animals has progressed, EVs have been discovered 
      in the venom of snakes and parasitic wasps. Although vesicle secretion in spider 
      venom glands has been observed, these secretory vesicles' origin and biological 
      properties are unknown. In this study, the origin of the EVs from Ornithoctonus 
      hainana venom was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The 
      Ornithoctonus hainana venom extracellular vesicles (HN-EVs) were isolated and 
      purified by density gradient centrifugation. HN-EVs possess classic membranous 
      vesicles with a size distribution ranging from 50 to 150 nm and express the 
      arthropod EV marker Tsp29Fb. The LC-MS/MS analysis identified a total of 150 
      proteins, which were divided into three groups according to their potential 
      function: conservative vesicle transport-related proteins, virulence-related 
      proteins, and other proteins of unknown function. Functionally, HN-EVs have 
      hyaluronidase activity and inhibit the proliferation of human umbilical vein 
      endothelial cells (HUVECs) by affecting the cytoskeleton and cell cycle. Overall, 
      this study investigates the biological characteristics of HN-EVs for the first time 
      and sheds new light on the envenomation process of spider venom.

      cloning, heterologous expression and immunological cross-reactivity approaches.

AB  - The venom of a Loxosceles spider is composed of a complex mixture of biologically 
      active components, consisting predominantly of low molecular mass molecules 
      (3-45 kDa). Transcriptome analysis of the Loxosceles intermedia venom gland revealed 
      ESTs with similarity to the previously described LiTx peptides. Sequences similar to 
      the LiTx3 isoform were the most abundant, representing approximately 13.9% of all 
      ESTs and 32% of the toxin-encoding messengers. These peptides are grouped in the ICK 
      (Inhibitor Cystine Knot) family, which contains single chain molecules with low 
      molecular mass (3-10 kDa). Due to their high number of cysteine residues, ICK 
      peptides form intramolecular disulfide bridges. The aims of this study were to clone 
      and express a novel ICK peptide isoform, as well as produce specific hyperimmune 
      serum for immunoassays. The corresponding cDNA was amplified by PCR using specific 
      primers containing restriction sites for the XhoI and BamHI enzymes; this PCR 
      product was then ligated in the pET-14b vector and transformed into E. coli AD494 
      (DE3) cells. The peptide was expressed by IPTG induction for 4 h at 30 °C and 
      purified by affinity chromatography with Ni-NTA resin. Hyperimmune serum to the 
      recombinant peptide was produced in rabbits and was able to specifically recognize 
      both the purified recombinant peptide and the native form present in the venom. 
      Furthermore, the recombinant peptide was recognized by antisera raised against L. 
      intermedia, L. gaucho and L. laeta whole venoms. The recombinant peptide obtained 
      will enable future studies to characterize its biological activity, as well as 
      investigations regarding possible biotechnological applications.

AB  - Heteropoda venatoria in the family Sparassidae is highly valued in pantropical 
      countries because the species feed on domestic insect pests. Unlike most other 
      species of Araneomorphae, H. venatoria uses the great speed and strong chelicerae 
      (mouthparts) with toxin glands to capture the insects instead of its web. Therefore, 
      H. venatoria provides unique opportunities for venom evolution research. The venom 
      of H. venatoria was explored by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem 
      time-of-flight and analyzing expressed sequence tags. The 154 sequences coding 
      cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs) revealed 24 families based on the phylogenetic 
      analyses of precursors and cysteine frameworks in the putative mature regions. 
      Intriguingly, four kinds of motifs are first described in spider venom. Furthermore, 
      combining the diverse CRPs of H. venatoria with previous spider venom peptidomics 
      data, the structures of precursors and the patterns of cysteine frameworks were 
      analyzed. This work revealed the dynamic evolutionary trends of venom CRPs in H. 
      venatoria: the precursor has evolved an extended mature peptide with more cysteines, 
      and a diminished or even vanished propeptides between the signal and mature 
      peptides; and the CRPs evolved by multiple duplications of an ancestral ICK gene as 
      well as recruitments of non-toxin genes.

TI  - Effects of Gene Duplication, Positive Selection, and Shifts in Gene Expression on 
      the Evolution of the Venom Gland Transcriptome in Widow Spiders.
PG  - 228-42
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evv253 [doi]
AB  - Gene duplication and positive selection can be important determinants of the 
      evolution of venom, a protein-rich secretion used in prey capture and defense. In a 
      typical model of venom evolution, gene duplicates switch to venom gland expression 
      and change function under the action of positive selection, which together with 
      further duplication produces large gene families encoding diverse toxins. Although 
      these processes have been demonstrated for individual toxin families, 
      high-throughput multitissue sequencing of closely related venomous species can 
      provide insights into evolutionary dynamics at the scale of the entire venom gland 
      transcriptome. By assembling and analyzing multitissue transcriptomes from the 
      Western black widow spider and two closely related species with distinct venom 
      toxicity phenotypes, we do not find that gene duplication and duplicate retention is 
      greater in gene families with venom gland biased expression in comparison with 
      broadly expressed families. Positive selection has acted on some venom toxin 
      families, but does not appear to be in excess for families with venom gland biased 
      expression. Moreover, we find 309 distinct gene families that have single 
      transcripts with venom gland biased expression, suggesting that the switching of 
      genes to venom gland expression in numerous unrelated gene families has been a 
      dominant mode of evolution. We also find ample variation in protein sequences of 
      venom gland-specific transcripts, lineage-specific family sizes, and ortholog 
      expression among species. This variation might contribute to the variable venom 
      toxicity of these species.

AB  - Widow spiders have received much attention due to the frequently reported human and 
      animal injures caused by them. Elucidation of the molecular composition and action 
      mechanism of the venoms and toxins has vast implications in the treatment of 
      latrodectism and in the neurobiology and pharmaceutical research. In recent years, 
      the studies of the widow spider venoms and the venom toxins, particularly the 
      α-latrotoxin, have achieved many new advances; however, the mechanism of action of 
      the venom toxins has not been completely clear. The widow spider is different from 
      many other venomous animals in that it has toxic components not only in the venom 
      glands but also in other parts of the adult spider body, newborn spiderlings, and 
      even the eggs. More recently, the molecular basis for the toxicity outside the venom 
      glands has been systematically investigated, with four proteinaceous toxic 
      components being purified and preliminarily characterized, which has expanded our 
      understanding of the widow spider toxins. This review presents a glance at the 
      recent advances in the study on the venoms and toxins from the Latrodectus species.

TI  - Not so Dangerous After All? Venom Composition and Potency of the Pholcid (Daddy 
      Long-Leg) Spider Physocyclus mexicanus.
LID - 256 [pii]
LID - 10.3389/fevo.2019.00256 [doi]
AB  - Pholcid spiders (Araneae: Pholcidae), officially "cellar spiders" but popularly 
      known as "daddy long-legs," are renown for the potential of deadly toxic venom, even 
      though venom composition and potency has never formally been studied. Here we detail 
      the venom composition of male Physocyclus mexicanus using proteomic analyses and 
      venom-gland transcriptomes ("venomics"). We also analyze the venom's potency on 
      insects, and assemble available evidence regarding mammalian toxicity. The majority 
      of the venom (51% of tryptic polypeptides and 62% of unique tryptic peptides) 
      consists of proteins homologous to known venom toxins including enzymes (astacin 
      metalloproteases, serine proteases and metalloendopeptidases, particularly 
      neprilysins) and venom peptide neurotoxins. We identify 17 new groups of peptides 
      (U(1-17)-PHTX) most of which are homologs of known venom peptides and are predicted 
      to have an inhibitor cysteine knot fold; of these, 13 are confirmed in the proteome. 
      Neprilysins (M13 peptidases), and astacins (M12 peptidases) are the most abundant 
      venom proteins, respectively representing 15 and 11% of the individual proteins and 
      32 and 20% of the tryptic peptides detected in crude venom. Comparative evidence 
      suggests that the neprilysin gene family is expressed in venoms across a range of 
      spider taxa, but has undergone an expansion in the venoms of pholcids and may play a 
      central functional role in these spiders. Bioassays of crude venoms on crickets 
      resulted in an effective paralytic dose of 3.9 µg/g, which is comparable to that of 
      crude venoms of Plectreurys tristis and other Synspermiata taxa. However, crickets 
      exhibit flaccid paralysis and regions of darkening that are not observed after P. 
      tristis envenomation. Documented bites on humans make clear that while these spiders 
      can bite, the typical result is a mild sting with no long-lasting effects. Together, 
      the evidence we present indicates pholcid venoms are a source of interesting new 
      peptides and proteins, and effects of bites on humans and other mammals are 
      inconsequential.

TI  - House spider genome uncovers evolutionary shifts in the diversity and expression of 
      black widow venom proteins associated with extreme toxicity.
PG  - 178
LID - 10.1186/s12864-017-3551-7 [doi]
LID - 178
AB  - BACKGROUND: Black widow spiders are infamous for their neurotoxic venom, which can 
      cause extreme and long-lasting pain. This unusual venom is dominated by latrotoxins 
      and latrodectins, two protein families virtually unknown outside of the black widow 
      genus Latrodectus, that are difficult to study given the paucity of spider genomes. 
      Using tissue-, sex- and stage-specific expression data, we analyzed the recently 
      sequenced genome of the house spider (Parasteatoda tepidariorum), a close relative 
      of black widows, to investigate latrotoxin and latrodectin diversity, expression and 
      evolution. RESULTS: We discovered at least 47 latrotoxin genes in the house spider 
      genome, many of which are tandem-arrayed. Latrotoxins vary extensively in predicted 
      structural domains and expression, implying their significant functional 
      diversification. Phylogenetic analyses show latrotoxins have substantially 
      duplicated after the Latrodectus/Parasteatoda split and that they are also related 
      to proteins found in endosymbiotic bacteria. Latrodectin genes are less numerous 
      than latrotoxins, but analyses show their recruitment for venom function from 
      neuropeptide hormone genes following duplication, inversion and domain truncation. 
      While latrodectins and other peptides are highly expressed in house spider and black 
      widow venom glands, latrotoxins account for a far smaller percentage of house spider 
      venom gland expression. CONCLUSIONS: The house spider genome sequence provides novel 
      insights into the evolution of venom toxins once considered unique to black widows. 
      Our results greatly expand the size of the latrotoxin gene family, reinforce its 
      narrow phylogenetic distribution, and provide additional evidence for the lateral 
      transfer of latrotoxins between spiders and bacterial endosymbionts. Moreover, we 
      strengthen the evidence for the evolution of latrodectin venom genes from the 
      ecdysozoan Ion Transport Peptide (ITP)/Crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormone (CHH) 
      neuropeptide superfamily. The lower expression of latrotoxins in house spiders 
      relative to black widows, along with the absence of a vertebrate-targeting 
      α-latrotoxin gene in the house spider genome, may account for the extreme potency of 
      black widow venom.

TI  - Isolation, N-glycosylations and Function of a Hyaluronidase-Like Enzyme from the

AB  - STRUCTURE OF CUPIENNIUS SALEI VENOM HYALURONIDASE: Hyaluronidases are important 
      venom components acting as spreading factor of toxic compounds. In several studies 
      this spreading effect was tested on vertebrate tissue. However, data about the 
      spreading activity on invertebrates, the main prey organisms of spiders, are 
      lacking. Here, a hyaluronidase-like enzyme was isolated from the venom of the spider 
      Cupiennius salei. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme was determined by cDNA 
      analysis of the venom gland transcriptome and confirmed by protein analysis. Two 
      complex N-linked glycans akin to honey bee hyaluronidase glycosylations, were 
      identified by tandem mass spectrometry. A C-terminal EGF-like domain was identified 
      in spider hyaluronidase using InterPro. The spider hyaluronidase-like enzyme showed 
      maximal activity at acidic pH, between 40-60°C, and 0.2 M KCl. Divalent ions did not 
      enhance HA degradation activity, indicating that they are not recruited for 
      catalysis. FUNCTION OF VENOM HYALURONIDASES: Besides hyaluronan, the enzyme degrades 
      chondroitin sulfate A, whereas heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate are not 
      affected. The end products of hyaluronan degradation are tetramers, whereas 
      chondroitin sulfate A is mainly degraded to hexamers. Identification of terminal 
      N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine at the reducing end of the oligomers 
      identified the enzyme as an endo-β-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase hydrolase. The 
      spreading effect of the hyaluronidase-like enzyme on invertebrate tissue was studied 
      by coinjection of the enzyme with the Cupiennius salei main neurotoxin CsTx-1 into 
      Drosophila flies. The enzyme significantly enhances the neurotoxic activity of 
      CsTx-1. Comparative substrate degradation tests with hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfate 
      A, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate with venoms from 39 spider species from 21 
      families identified some spider families (Atypidae, Eresidae, Araneidae and 
      Nephilidae) without activity of hyaluronidase-like enzymes. This is interpreted as a 
      loss of this enzyme and fits quite well the current phylogenetic idea on a more 
      isolated position of these families and can perhaps be explained by specialized prey 
      catching techniques.

TI  - A venom-derived neurotoxin, CsTx-1, from the spider Cupiennius salei exhibits 
      cytolytic activities.
PG  - 25640-9
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.339051 [doi]
AB  - CsTx-1, the main neurotoxic acting peptide in the venom of the spider Cupiennius 
      salei, is composed of 74 amino acid residues, exhibits an inhibitory cysteine knot 
      motif, and is further characterized by its highly cationic charged C terminus. Venom 
      gland cDNA library analysis predicted a prepropeptide structure for CsTx-1 
      precursor. In the presence of trifluoroethanol, CsTx-1 and the long C-terminal part 
      alone (CT1-long; Gly-45-Lys-74) exhibit an α-helical structure, as determined by CD 
      measurements. CsTx-1 and CT1-long are insecticidal toward Drosophila flies and 
      destroys Escherichia coli SBS 363 cells. CsTx-1 causes a stable and irreversible 
      depolarization of insect larvae muscle cells and frog neuromuscular preparations, 
      which seem to be receptor-independent. Furthermore, this membranolytic activity 
      could be measured for Xenopus oocytes, in which CsTx-1 and CT1-long increase ion 
      permeability non-specifically. These results support our assumption that the 
      membranolytic activities of CsTx-1 are caused by its C-terminal tail, CT1-long. 
      Together, CsTx-1 exhibits two different functions; as a neurotoxin it inhibits 
      L-type Ca(2+) channels, and as a membranolytic peptide it destroys a variety of 
      prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell membranes. Such a dualism is discussed as an 
      important new mechanism for the evolution of spider venomous peptides.

AB  - Venoms have attracted enormous attention because of their potent physiological 
      effects and dynamic evolution, including the convergent recruitment of homologous 
      genes for venom expression. Here we provide novel evidence for the recruitment of 
      genes from the Crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormone (CHH) and arthropod Ion Transport 
      Peptide (ITP) superfamily for venom expression in black widow spiders. We 
      characterized latrodectin peptides from venom gland cDNAs from the Western black 
      widow spider (Latrodectus hesperus), the brown widow (Latrodectus geometricus) and 
      cupboard spider (Steatoda grossa). Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences with 
      homologs from other spider, scorpion and wasp venom cDNAs, as well as CHH/ITP 
      neuropeptides, show latrodectins as derived members of the CHH/ITP superfamily. 
      These analyses suggest that CHH/ITP homologs are more widespread in spider venoms, 
      and were recruited for venom expression in two additional arthropod lineages. We 
      also found that the latrodectin 2 gene and nearly all CHH/ITP genes include a phase 
      2 intron in the same position, supporting latrodectin's placement within the CHH/ITP 
      superfamily. Evolutionary analyses of latrodectins suggest episodes of positive 
      selection along some sequence lineages, and positive and purifying selection on 
      specific codons, supporting its functional importance in widow venom. We consider 
      how this improved understanding of latrodectin evolution informs functional 
      hypotheses regarding its role in black widow venom as well as its potential 
      convergent recruitment for venom expression across arthropods.

AB  - In the venom of spiders, linear peptides (LPs), also called cytolytical or 
      antimicrobial peptides, represent a largely neglected group of mostly membrane 
      active substances that contribute in some spider species considerably to the killing 
      power of spider venom. By next-generation sequencing venom gland transcriptome 
      analysis, we investigated 48 spider species from 23 spider families and detected LPs 
      in 20 species, belonging to five spider families (Ctenidae, Lycosidae, Oxyopidae, 
      Pisauridae, and Zodariidae). The structural diversity is extraordinary high in some 
      species: the lynx spider Oxyopes heterophthalmus contains 62 and the lycosid Pardosa 
      palustris 60 different LPs. In total, we identified 524 linear peptide structures 
      and some of them are in lycosids identical on amino acid level. LPs are mainly 
      encoded in complex precursor structures in which, after the signal peptide and 
      propeptide, 13 or more LPs (Hogna radiata) are connected by linkers. Besides 
      Cupiennius species, also in Oxyopidae, posttranslational modifications of some 
      precursor structures result in the formation of two-chain peptides. It is obvious 
      that complex precursor structures represent a very suitable and fast method to 
      produce a high number and a high diversity of bioactive LPs as economically as 
      possible. At least in Lycosidae, Oxyopidae, and in the genus Cupiennius, LPs reach 
      very high Transcripts Per Kilobase Million values, indicating functional importance 
      within the envenomation process.

AB  - Loxosceles spiders are found in almost all countries of South America. In Peru, 
      Loxosceles laeta species is the main responsible for the accidents caused by 
      poisonous animals, being known as "killer spiders", due to the large number of fatal 
      accidents observed. Astacin-like metalloproteases, named LALPs (Loxosceles 
      astacin-like metalloproteases) are highly expressed in Loxosceles spiders venom 
      gland. These proteases may be involved in hemorrhage and venom spreading, being 
      relevant to the envenoming proccess. Thus, the aim of this work was to analyze 
      Peruvian L. laeta venom gland transcripts using bioinformatics tools, focusing on 
      LALPs. A cDNA library from Peruvian L. laeta venom glands was constructed and 
      sequenced by MiSeq (Illumina) sequencer. After assembly, the resulting sequences 
      were annotated, seeking out for similarity with previously described LALPs. Nine 
      possible LALPs isoforms from Peruvian L. laeta venom were identified and the results 
      were validated by in silico and in vitro experiments. This study contributes to a 
      better understanding of the molecular diversity of Loxosceles venom and provide 
      insights about the action of LALPs.

TI  - David and Goliath: potent venom of an ant-eating spider (Araneae) enables capture of 
      a giant prey.
PG  - 533-40

AB  - It is rare to find a true predator that repeatedly and routinely kills prey larger 
      than itself. A solitary specialised ant-eating spider of the genus Zodarion can 
      capture a relatively giant prey. We studied the trophic niche of this spider species 
      and investigated its adaptations (behavioural and venomic) that are used to capture 
      ants. We found that the spider captures mainly polymorphic Messor arenarius ants. 
      Adult female spiders captured large morphs while tiny juveniles captured smaller 
      morphs, yet in both cases ants were giant in comparison with spider size. All 
      specimens used an effective prey capture strategy that protected them from ant 
      retaliation. Juvenile and adult spiders were able to paralyse their prey using a 
      single bite. The venom glands of adults were more than 50 times larger than those of 
      juvenile spiders, but the paralysis latency of juveniles was 1.5 times longer. This 
      suggests that this spider species possesses very potent venom already at the 
      juvenile stage. Comparison of the venom composition between juvenile and adult 
      spiders did not reveal significant differences. We discovered here that specialised 
      capture combined with very effective venom enables the capture of giant prey.

TI  - A novel hyaluronidase from brown spider (Loxosceles intermedia) venom (Dietrich's 
      Hyaluronidase): from cloning to functional characterization.
PG  - e2206
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002206 [doi]
LID - e2206
AB  - Loxoscelism is the designation given to clinical symptoms evoked by Loxosceles 
      spider's bites. Clinical manifestations include skin necrosis with gravitational 
      spreading and systemic disturbs. The venom contains several enzymatic toxins. 
      Herein, we describe the cloning, expression, refolding and biological evaluation of 
      a novel brown spider protein characterized as a hyaluronidase. Employing a venom 
      gland cDNA library, we cloned a hyaluronidase (1200 bp cDNA) that encodes for a 
      signal peptide and a mature protein. Amino acid alignment revealed a structural 
      relationship with members of hyaluronidase family, such as scorpion and snake 
      species. Recombinant hyaluronidase was expressed as N-terminal His-tag fusion 
      protein (∼45 kDa) in inclusion bodies and activity was achieved using refolding. 
      Immunoblot analysis showed that antibodies that recognize the recombinant protein 
      cross-reacted with hyaluronidase from whole venom as well as an anti-venom serum 
      reacted with recombinant protein. Recombinant hyaluronidase was able to degrade 
      purified hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), while dermatan sulfate 
      (DS) and heparan sulfate (HS) were not affected. Zymograph experiments resulted in 
      ∼45 kDa lytic zones in hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) substrates. 
      Through in vivo experiments of dermonecrosis using rabbit skin, the recombinant 
      hyaluronidase was shown to increase the dermonecrotic effect produced by recombinant 
      dermonecrotic toxin from L. intermedia venom (LiRecDT1). These data support the 
      hypothesis that hyaluronidase is a "spreading factor". Recombinant hyaluronidase 
      provides a useful tool for biotechnological ends. We propose the name Dietrich's 
      Hyaluronidase for this enzyme, in honor of Professor Carl Peter von Dietrich, who 
      dedicated his life to studying proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of the Venom Gland Transcriptomes of the Fishing Spiders 
      Dolomedes mizhoanus and Dolomedes sulfurous.

AB  - Dolomedes sulfurous and Dolomedes mizhoanus are predaceous arthropods catching and 
      feeding on small fish. They live in the same area and have similar habits. Their 
      venoms exhibit some similarities and differences in biochemical and 
      electrophysiological properties. In the present work, we first performed a 
      transcriptomic analysis by constructing the venom gland cDNA library of D. sulfurous 
      and 127 novel putative toxin sequences were consequently identified, which were 
      classified into eight families. This venom gland transcriptome was then compared 
      with that of D. mizhoanus, which revealed that the putative toxins from both spider 
      venoms might have originated from the same gene ancestors although novel toxins were 
      evolved independently in the two spiders. The putative toxins from both spiders 
      contain 6-12 cysteine residues forming seven cysteine patterns. As revealed by blast 
      search, the two venoms are rich in neurotoxins targeting ion channels with 
      pharmacological and therapeutic significance. This study provides insight into the 
      venoms of two closely related species of spider, which will be of use for future 
      investigations into the structure and function of their toxins.

TI  - The Dual Prey-Inactivation Strategy of Spiders-In-Depth Venomic Analysis of 
      Cupiennius salei.
LID - 10.3390/toxins11030167 [doi]
LID - 167
AB  - Most knowledge of spider venom concerns neurotoxins acting on ion channels, whereas 
      proteins and their significance for the envenomation process are neglected. The here 
      presented comprehensive analysis of the venom gland transcriptome and proteome of 
      Cupiennius salei focusses on proteins and cysteine-containing peptides and offers 
      new insight into the structure and function of spider venom, here described as the 
      dual prey-inactivation strategy. After venom injection, many enzymes and proteins, 
      dominated by α-amylase, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and cysteine-rich secretory 
      proteins, interact with main metabolic pathways, leading to a major disturbance of 
      the cellular homeostasis. Hyaluronidase and cytolytic peptides destroy tissue and 
      membranes, thus supporting the spread of other venom compounds. We detected 81 
      transcripts of neurotoxins from 13 peptide families, whereof two families comprise 
      93.7% of all cysteine-containing peptides. This raises the question of the 
      importance of the other low-expressed peptide families. The identification of a 
      venom gland-specific defensin-like peptide and an aga-toxin-like peptide in the 
      hemocytes offers an important clue on the recruitment and neofunctionalization of 
      body proteins and peptides as the origin of toxins.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) pollution is currently the most serious type of heavy metal pollution 
      throughout the world. Previous studies have shown that Cd elevates the mortality of 
      paddy field spiders, but the lethal mechanism remains to be explored profoundly. In 
      the present study, we measured the activities of protective enzymes 
      (acetylcholinesterase, glutathione peroxidase, phenol oxidase) and a heavy metal 
      chelating protein (metallothionein) in the pond wolf spider Pardosa pseudoannulata 
      after Cd exposure. The results indicated that Cd initially increased the enzyme 
      activities and protein concentration of the spider after 10- and 20-day exposure 
      before inhibiting them at 30-day exposure. Further analysis showed that the enzyme 
      activities in the cephalothorax were inhibited to some extent. Since the 
      cephalothorax region contains important venom glands, we performed transcriptome 
      sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the venom glands collected from the spiders after 
      long-term Cd exposure. RNA-seq yielded a total of 2826 differentially expressed 
      genes (DEGs), and most of the DEGs were annotated into the process of protein 
      synthesis, processing and degradation. Furthermore, a mass of genes involved in 
      protein recognition and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -associated protein degradation 
      were down-regulated. The reduction of protease activities supports the view that 
      protein synthesis and degradation in organelles and cytoplasm were dramatically 
      inhibited. Collectively, our outcomes illustrate that Cd poses adverse effects on 
      the expression of protective enzymes and protein, which potentially down-regulates 
      the immune function in the venom glands of the spiders via the alteration of protein 
      processing and degradation in the ER.

      Latrotoxins Is Tissue- and Life Stage-Specific for α-Latroinsectotoxins and 
      δ-Latroinsectotoxins and Is Ubiquitous for α-Latrotoxins.

AB  - Widow spiders are widely known for their potent venom toxins that make them among 
      the few spiders of medical concern. The latrotoxins are the most well-studied widow 
      toxins and include both the vertebrate-specific latrotoxins and the insect-specific 
      latroinsectotoxins (LITs). Previous studies have shown that toxins are not limited 
      to expression in the venom glands of adult spiders; however, gaps exist in 
      latrotoxin screening across all life stages for brown widows, Latrodectus 
      geometricus and southern black widows, Latrodectus mactans. In this study, we 
      screened male and female venom gland, cephalothorax, and abdomen tissues, spiderling 
      cephalothorax and abdomen tissues, and eggs of both L. geometricus and L. mactans, 
      for the presence of three latrotoxins: α-latrotoxin (α-LTX), and α- and 
      δ-latroinsectotoxins (α/δ-LITs). Widows were locally collected. Extracted RNA was 
      used to prepare cDNA that was analyzed by PCR for the presence or absence of 
      latrotoxin expression. Results show that expression profiles between the two species 
      are very similar but not identical. Expression of α-LTX was found in all life stages 
      in all tissues examined for both species. For both species, no LIT expression was 
      detected in eggs and variable patterns of α-LIT expression were detected in 
      spiderlings and adults. Notably, δ-LIT could only be detected in females for both 
      species. Our results show that latrotoxin expression profiles differ within and 
      between widow species. Data on their expression distribution provide further insight 
      into the specific latrotoxins that contribute to toxicity profiles for each life 
      stage in each species and their specific role in widow biology.

AB  - Sheep flystrike is caused by parasitic flies laying eggs on soiled wool or open 
      wounds, after which the hatched maggots feed on the sheep flesh and often cause 
      large lesions. It is a significant economic problem for the livestock industry as 
      infestations are difficult to control due to ongoing cycles of larval development 
      into flies followed by further egg laying. We therefore screened venom fractions 
      from the Australian theraphosid spider Coremiocnemis tropix to identify toxins 
      active against the sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina, which is the primary cause of 
      flystrike in Australia. This screen led to isolation of two insecticidal peptides, 
      Ct1a and Ct1b, that are lethal to blowflies within 24 h of injection. The primary 
      structure of these peptides was determined using a combination of Edman degradation 
      and sequencing of a C. tropix venom-gland transcriptome. Ct1a and Ct1b contain 39 
      and 38 amino acid residues, respectively, including six cysteine residues that form 
      three disulfide bonds. Recombinant production in bacteria (Escherichia coli) 
      resulted in low yields of Ct1a whereas solid-phase peptide synthesis using native 
      chemical ligation produced sufficient quantities of Ct1a for functional analyses. 
      Synthetic Ct1a had no effect on voltage-gated sodium channels from the American 
      cockroach Periplanata americana or the German cockroach Blattella germanica, but it 
      was lethal to sheep blowflies with an LD(50) of 1687 pmol/g.

AB  - Loxosceles venom comprises a mixture of diverse toxins that induces intense local 
      inflammatory reaction, dermonecrotic injury, platelet aggregation, hemolytic anemia 
      and acute renal failure. Among several toxins in the venom, phospholipases D (PLDs), 
      also called dermonecrotic toxins, are the most important and best studied, since 
      they account for the main effects observed in loxoscelism. Despite their importance, 
      biological analysis of PLDs is hampered by the minute amounts normally purified from 
      the venom, and therefore many efforts have been made to clone those toxins. However, 
      to date, no PLD from Loxosceles gaucho has been obtained in a heterologous system. 
      Thus, in this work we show the cloning of a PLD from L. gaucho venom gland, named 
      LgRec1, which was successfully expressed in a bacterial system. LgRec1 evoked local 
      reaction (edema, erythema, ecchymosis, and paleness), dermonecrosis and hemolysis. 
      It was also able to hydrolyze sphingomyelin and promote platelet aggregation. ELISA 
      and Western blot analysis showed that LgRec1 was recognized by an anti-L. gaucho 
      venom serum, a commercial arachnidic antivenom as well as a monoclonal antibody 
      raised against the dermonecrotic fraction of L. gaucho venom. In addition, LgRec1 
      demonstrated to be highly immunogenic and antibodies raised against this recombinant 
      toxin inhibited local reaction (~65%) and dermonecrosis (~100%) elicited by L. 
      gaucho whole venom. Since PLDs are considered the major components accounting for 
      the local and systemic envenomation effects caused by spiders from genus Loxosceles, 
      the information provided here may help to understand the mechanisms behind clinical 
      symptomatology.

TI  - Acute Toxicity of the Recombinant and Native Phα1β Toxin: New Analgesic from 
      Phoneutria nigriventer Spider Venom.
LID - 10.3390/toxins10120531 [doi]
LID - 531
AB  - Phα1β, a purified peptide from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, and 
      its recombinant form CTK 01512-2 are voltage-dependent calcium channel (Ca(V)) 
      blockers of types N, R, P/Q, and L with a preference for type N. These peptides show 
      analgesic action in different pain models in rats. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the acute intrathecal toxicity of the native and recombinant Phα1β toxin in 
      Wistar rats. Clinical signs, serum biochemistry, organ weight, and histopathological 
      alterations were evaluated in male and/or female rats. Dyspnea was observed in 
      males, hyporesponsiveness in females, and Straub tail and tremors in both genders. 
      There were no significant differences in male organ weight, although significant 
      differences in the female relative weight of the adrenal glands and spleen have been 
      observed; these values are within the normal range. Serum biochemical data revealed 
      a significant reduction within the physiological limits of species related to urea, 
      ALT, AST, and FA. Hepatic and renal congestion were observed for toxin groups. In 
      renal tissue, glomerular infiltrates were observed with increased glomerular space. 
      These histological alterations were presented in focal areas and in mild degree. 
      Therefore, Phα1β and CTK 01512-2 presented a good safety profile with transient 
      toxicity clinical signals in doses higher than used to obtain the analgesic effect.

AB  - Spiderines are comparatively long polypeptide toxins (∼110 residues) from lynx 
      spiders (genus Oxyopes). They are built of an N-terminal linear cationic domain (∼40 
      residues) and a C-terminal knottin domain (∼60 residues). The linear domain empowers 
      spiderines with strong cytolytic activity. In the present work we report 16 novel 
      spiderine sequences from Oxyopes takobius and Oxyopes lineatus classified into two 
      subfamilies. Strikingly, negative selection acts on both linear and knottin domains. 
      Genes encoding Oxyopes two-domain toxins were sequenced and found to be intronless. 
      We further discuss a possible scenario of lynx spider modular toxin evolution.

TI  - Transcriptomic Analysis of Pseudoscorpion Venom Reveals a Unique Cocktail Dominated 
      by Enzymes and Protease Inhibitors.
LID - 10.3390/toxins10050207 [doi]
LID - 207
AB  - Transcriptomic and genomic analyses have illuminated the diversity of venoms in 
      three of the four venomous arachnid orders (scorpions, spiders, and ticks). To date, 
      no venom gland transcriptome analysis has been available for pseudoscorpions, the 
      fourth venomous arachnid lineage. To redress this gap, we sequenced an mRNA library 
      generated from the venom glands of the species Synsphyronus apimelus (Garypidae). 
      High-throughput sequencing by the Illumina protocol, followed by de novo assembly, 
      resulted in a total of 238,331 transcripts. From those, we annotated 131 
      transcripts, which code for putative peptides/proteins with similar sequences to 
      previously reported venom components available from different arachnid species in 
      protein databases. Transcripts putatively coding for enzymes showed the richest 
      diversity, followed by other venom components such as peptidase inhibitors, 
      cysteine-rich peptides, and thyroglobulin 1-like peptides. Only 11 transcripts were 
      found that code for putatively low molecular mass spider toxins. This study 
      constitutes the first report of the diversity of components within pseudoscorpion 
      venom.

AB  - Venom based research is exploited to find novel candidates for the development of 
      innovative pharmacological tools, drug candidates and new ingredients for cosmetic 
      and agrochemical industries. Moreover, venomics, as a well-established approach in 
      systems biology, helps to elucidate the genetic mechanisms of the production of such 
      a great molecular biodiversity. Today the advances made in the proteomics, 
      transcriptomics and bioinformatics fields, favor venomics, allowing the in depth 
      study of complex matrices and the elucidation even of minor compounds present in 
      minute biological samples. The present study illustrates a rapid and efficient 
      method developed for the elucidation of venom composition based on NextGen mRNA 
      sequencing of venom glands and LC-MS/MS venom proteome profiling. The analysis of 
      the comprehensive data obtained was focused on cysteine rich peptide toxins from 
      four spider species originating from phylogenetically distant families for 
      comparison purposes. The studied species were Heteropoda davidbowie (Sparassidae), 
      Poecilotheria formosa (Theraphosidae), Viridasius fasciatus (Viridasiidae) and 
      Latrodectus mactans (Theridiidae). This led to a high resolution profiling of 284 
      characterized cysteine rich peptides, 111 of which belong to the Inhibitor Cysteine 
      Knot (ICK) structural motif. The analysis of H. davidbowie venom revealed a high 
      richness in term of venom diversity: 95 peptide sequences were identified; out of 
      these, 32 peptides presented the ICK structural motif and could be classified in six 
      distinct families. The profiling of P. formosa venom highlighted the presence of 126 
      peptide sequences, with 52 ICK toxins belonging to three structural distinct 
      families. V. fasciatus venom was shown to contain 49 peptide sequences, out of which 
      22 presented the ICK structural motif and were attributed to five families. The 
      venom of L. mactans, until now studied for its large neurotoxins (Latrotoxins), 
      revealed the presence of 14 cysteine rich peptides, out of which five were ICK 
      toxins belonging to the CSTX superfamily. This in depth profiling of distinct ICK 
      peptide families identified across the four spider species highlighted the high 
      conservation of these neurotoxins among spider families.

PG  - 170-7

AB  - Envenoming with brown spiders (Loxosceles genus) is common throughout the world. 
      Cutaneous symptoms following spider bite accidents include dermonecrosis, erythema, 
      itching and pain. In some cases, accidents can cause hypersensibility or even 
      allergic reactions. These responses could be associated with histaminergic events, 
      such as an increase in vascular permeability and vasodilatation. A protein that may 
      be related to the effects of spider venom was identified from a previously obtained 
      cDNA library of the L. intermedia venom gland. The amino acid sequence of this 
      protein is homologous to proteins from the TCTP (translationally-controlled tumor 
      protein) family, which are extracellular histamine-releasing factors (HRF) that are 
      associated with the allergic reactions to parasites. Herein, we described the 
      cloning, heterologous expression, purification and functional characterization of a 
      novel member of the TCTP family from the Loxosceles intermedia venom gland. This 
      recombinant protein, named LiRecTCTP, causes edema, enhances vascular permeability 
      and is likely related to the inflammatory activity of the venom. Moreover, LiRecTCTP 
      presents an immunological relationship with mammalian TCTPs.

TI  - Fatty Acid Modification of the Anticancer Peptide LVTX-9 to Enhance Its Cytotoxicity 
      against Malignant Melanoma Cells.
LID - 10.3390/toxins13120867 [doi]
LID - 867
AB  - Spider venom is a valuable resource for the development of novel anticancer drugs. 
      In this study, we focused on novel linear amphipathic α-helical anticancer peptide 
      LVTX-9, which was derived from the cDNA library of the venom gland of the spider 
      Lycosa vittata. The cytotoxicity of LVTX-9 against murine melanoma cells in the 
      range of 1.56-200 μM was tested and found to be significantly lower than those of 
      most anticancer peptides reported. Its IC(50) was determined to be 59.2 ± 19.8 μM in 
      a serum or 76.3 ± 12.7 μM in serum-free medium. Fatty acid modification is a 
      promising strategy for improving peptide performance. Therefore, to enhance the 
      cytotoxic activity of LVTX-9, fatty acid modification of this peptide was performed, 
      and five different carbon chain length lipopeptides named LVTX-9-C(12)-C(20) were 
      produced. Among them, the lipopeptide LVTX-9-C(18) showed the highest cytotoxic 
      activity in relation to B16-F10 cells, whether in a serum or serum-free medium. Most 
      importantly, the cytotoxic activity of LVTX-9-C(18) was improved by about 12.9 times 
      in a serum medium or 19.3 times in a serum-free medium compared to that of LVTX-9. 
      Subsequently, assays including scanning electron microscopy, trypan blue staining, 
      lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay, and hemolytic activity could indicate that the 
      potential direct cell membrane disruption is the main mechanism of LVTX-9-C(18) to 
      induce cancer cell death. Furthermore, the LVTX-9-C(18) also showed strong 
      cytotoxicity in relation to 3D B16-F10 spheroids, which indicates it might be a 
      promising lead for developing anticancer drugs.

TI  - Spit and venom from scytodes spiders: a diverse and distinct cocktail.
PG  - 817-35
LID - 10.1021/pr400875s [doi]
AB  - Spiders from the family Scytodidae have a unique prey capturing technique: they spit 
      a zig-zagged silken glue to tether prey to a surface. Effectiveness of this sticky 
      mixture is based on a combination of contraction and adhesion, trapping prey until 
      the spider immobilizes it by envenomation and then feeds. We identify components 
      expressed in Scytodes thoracica venom glands using combined transcriptomic and 
      proteomic analyses. These include homologues of toxic proteins astacin 
      metalloproteases and potentially toxic proteins including venom allergen, 
      longistatin, and translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP). We classify 19 
      distinct groups of candidate peptide toxins; 13 of these were detected in the venom, 
      making up 35% of the proteome. Six have significant similarity to toxins from spider 
      species spanning mygalomorph and nonhaplogyne araneomorph lineages, suggesting their 
      expression in venom is phylogenetically widespread. Twelve peptide toxin groups have 
      homologues in venom gland transcriptomes of other haplogynes. Of the transcripts, 
      approximately 50% encode glycine-rich peptides that may contribute to sticky fibers 
      in Scytodes spit. Fifty-one percent of the identified venom proteome is a family of 
      proteins that is homologous to sequences from Drosophila sp. and Latrodectus 
      hesperus with uncharacterized function. Characterization of these components holds 
      promise for discovering new functional activity.

TI  - Characterization of a Gene Coding for the Complement System Component FB from 
      Loxosceles laeta Spider Venom Glands.
PG  - e0146992
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0146992 [doi]
LID - e0146992
AB  - The human complement system is composed of more than 30 proteins and many of these 
      have conserved domains that allow tracing the phylogenetic evolution. The complement 
      system seems to be initiated with the appearance of C3 and factor B (FB), the only 
      components found in some protostomes and cnidarians, suggesting that the alternative 
      pathway is the most ancient. Here, we present the characterization of an arachnid 
      homologue of the human complement component FB from the spider Loxosceles laeta. 
      This homologue, named Lox-FB, was identified from a total RNA L. laeta spider venom 
      gland library and was amplified using RACE-PCR techniques and specific primers. 
      Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence and the domain structure showed 
      significant similarity to the vertebrate and invertebrate FB/C2 family proteins. 
      Lox-FB has a classical domain organization composed of a control complement protein 
      domain (CCP), a von Willebrand Factor domain (vWFA), and a serine protease domain 
      (SP). The amino acids involved in Mg2+ metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) 
      found in the vWFA domain in the vertebrate C2/FB proteins are well conserved; 
      however, the classic catalytic triad present in the serine protease domain is not 
      conserved in Lox-FB. Similarity and phylogenetic analyses indicated that Lox-FB 
      shares a major identity (43%) and has a close evolutionary relationship with the 
      third isoform of FB-like protein (FB-3) from the jumping spider Hasarius adansoni 
      belonging to the Family Salcitidae.

AB  - Proteins from TCTP/HRF family were identified as venom toxins of spiders from 
      different genus. We have found a TCTP toxin in the venom gland of Loxosceles 
      intermedia, a venomous spider very common in South Brazil. TCTP from L. intermedia, 
      named LiTCTP, was cloned, produced in a heterologous prokaryotic system, and the 
      recombinant toxin was biochemically characterized. Our results point that LiTCTP is 
      involved in the inflammatory events of Loxocelism, the clinical signs triggered 
      after Loxosceles sp. bite, which include intense inflammatory reaction at the bite 
      site followed by local necrosis. TCTP toxins were also identified in spiders from 
      different genus. There are very few articles about TCTP toxins in other venomous 
      animals in the literature, although a NCBI database search on the protein sequences 
      reveals TCTP on snake's venom glands transcriptomic and genomic studies. Studies on 
      TCTP as a venom toxin are very few and its biological role as a venom component in 
      prey capture is still unknown.

TI  - Venomic, Transcriptomic, and Bioactivity Analyses of Pamphobeteus verdolaga Venom 
      Reveal Complex Disulfide-Rich Peptides That Modulate Calcium Channels.
LID - 10.3390/toxins11090496 [doi]
LID - 496
AB  - Pamphobeteus verdolaga is a recently described Theraphosidae spider from the Andean 
      region of Colombia. Previous reports partially characterized its venom profile. In 
      this study, we conducted a detailed analysis that includes reversed-phase 
      high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-HPLC), calcium influx assays, tandem mass 
      spectrometry analysis (tMS/MS), and venom-gland transcriptome. rp-HPLC fractions of 
      P. verdolaga venom showed activity on Ca(V)2.2, Ca(V)3.2, and Na(V)1.7 ion channels. 
      Active fractions contained several peptides with molecular masses ranging from 
      3399.4 to 3839.6 Da. The tMS/MS analysis of active fraction displaying the strongest 
      activity to inhibit calcium channels showed sequence fragments similar to one of the 
      translated transcripts detected in the venom-gland transcriptome. The putative 
      peptide of this translated transcript corresponded to a toxin, here named 
      ω-theraphositoxin-Pv3a, a potential ion channel modulator toxin that is, in 
      addition, very similar to other theraphositoxins affecting calcium channels (i.e., 
      ω-theraphotoxin-Asp1a). Additionally, using this holistic approach, we found that P. 
      verdolaga venom is an important source of disulfide-rich proteins expressing at 
      least eight superfamilies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spiders (Order Araneae) are essential predators in every terrestrial 
      ecosystem largely because they have evolved potent arsenals of silk and venom. 
      Spider silks are high performance materials made almost entirely of proteins, and 
      thus represent an ideal system for investigating genome level evolution of novel 
      protein functions. However, genomic level resources remain limited for spiders. 
      RESULTS: We de novo assembled a transcriptome for the Western black widow 
      (Latrodectus hesperus) from deeply sequenced cDNAs of three tissue types. Our 
      multi-tissue assembly contained ~100,000 unique transcripts, of which > 27,000 were 
      annotated by homology. Comparing transcript abundance among the different tissues, 
      we identified 647 silk gland-specific transcripts, including the few known silk 
      fiber components (e.g. six spider fibroins, spidroins). Silk gland specific 
      transcripts are enriched compared to the entire transcriptome in several functions, 
      including protein degradation, inhibition of protein degradation, and 
      oxidation-reduction. Phylogenetic analyses of 37 gene families containing silk gland 
      specific transcripts demonstrated novel gene expansions within silk glands, and 
      multiple co-options of silk specific expression from paralogs expressed in other 
      tissues. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a transcriptional program for the silk glands that 
      involves regulating gland specific synthesis of silk fiber and glue components 
      followed by protecting and processing these components into functional fibers and 
      glues. Our black widow silk gland gene repertoire provides extensive expansion of 
      resources for biomimetic applications of silk in industry and medicine. Furthermore, 
      our multi-tissue transcriptome facilitates evolutionary analysis of arachnid genomes 
      and adaptive protein systems.

TI  - Dramatic expansion of the black widow toxin arsenal uncovered by multi-tissue 
      transcriptomics and venom proteomics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal venoms attract enormous interest given their potential for 
      pharmacological discovery and understanding the evolution of natural chemistries. 
      Next-generation transcriptomics and proteomics provide unparalleled, but 
      underexploited, capabilities for venom characterization. We combined multi-tissue 
      RNA-Seq with mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analyses to determine venom gland 
      specific transcripts and venom proteins from the Western black widow spider 
      (Latrodectus hesperus) and investigated their evolution. RESULTS: We estimated 
      expression of 97,217 L. hesperus transcripts in venom glands relative to silk and 
      cephalothorax tissues. We identified 695 venom gland specific transcripts (VSTs), 
      many of which BLAST and GO term analyses indicate may function as toxins or their 
      delivery agents. ~38% of VSTs had BLAST hits, including latrotoxins, inhibitor 
      cystine knot toxins, CRISPs, hyaluronidases, chitinase, and proteases, and 59% of 
      VSTs had predicted protein domains. Latrotoxins are venom toxins that cause massive 
      neurotransmitter release from vertebrate or invertebrate neurons. We discovered ≥ 20 
      divergent latrotoxin paralogs expressed in L. hesperus venom glands, significantly 
      increasing this biomedically important family. Mass spectrometry of L. hesperus 
      venom identified 49 proteins from VSTs, 24 of which BLAST to toxins. Phylogenetic 
      analyses showed venom gland specific gene family expansions and shifts in tissue 
      expression. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative expression analyses comparing multiple tissues 
      are necessary to identify venom gland specific transcripts. We present a black widow 
      venom specific exome that uncovers a trove of diverse toxins and associated 
      proteins, suggesting a dynamic evolutionary history. This justifies a reevaluation 
      of the functional activities of black widow venom in light of its emerging 
      complexity.

TI  - Anti-Toxoplasma gondii Effects of a Novel Spider Peptide XYP1 In Vitro and In Vivo.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines9080934 [doi]
LID - 934
AB  - Toxoplasmosis, caused by an obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii, is 
      one of the most prevalent zoonoses worldwide. Treatments for this disease by 
      traditional drugs have shown numerous side effects, thus effective alternative 
      anti-Toxoplasma strategies or drugs are urgently needed. In this study, a novel 
      spider peptide, XYP1, was identified from the cDNA library of the venom gland of the 
      spider Lycosa coelestis. Our results showed that XYP1 has potent anti-Toxoplasma 
      activity in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, treatment with XYP1 significantly 
      inhibited the viability, invasion and proliferation of tachyzoites with low 
      cytotoxicity (IC(50) = 38.79 μΜ) on human host cells, and increased the survival 
      rate of mice acutely infected with T. gondii. Next, scanning electron microscopy, 
      transmission electron microscopy and RNA sequencing were employed to further explore 
      the functional mechanism of XYP1, and the results indicated that XYP1 causes 
      membrane perforation, swelling and disruption of tachyzoites, which could be closely 
      associated with differential expression of several membrane-associated proteins 
      including HSP29. In conclusion, XYP1 may be a promising new drug candidate for the 
      treatment of toxoplasmosis.

AB  - There are many native species of animals with the potential to cause severe disease 
      in Portugal. Of the four clinically relevant snake species, the vipers (Vipera 
      latastei and Vipera seoanei) are the most concerning. They can cause severe disease 
      and require in-hospital management, monitoring and specific treatment, including the 
      administration of anti-snake venom serum. The Malpolon monspessulanus and 
      Macroprotodon brevis snakes cause mostly localized clinical manifestations, which do 
      not require specific treatment. Only a minority of the spider species in Portugal 
      possess chelicerae (mouthparts of the Chelicerata, shaped as either articulated 
      fangs or pincers, which may contain venom or be connected to the venom glands and 
      are used for predation or capture of food) long enough to perforate the human skin. 
      Nevertheless, Latrodectus tredecimguttatus and Loxosceles rufescens spider bites may 
      require specialized treatment in a hospital setting, as well as careful active 
      symptom surveillance. Diversely, the treatment for Scolopendra cingulata and 
      Scolopendra oraniensis centipedes' bites is merely symptomatic. The only existing 
      scorpion species in Portugal is the Buthus ibericus; its sting typically causes 
      local symptoms with intense pain, and its treatment consists essentially of 
      analgesia. The insects of the Hymenoptera order, such as bees and wasps, have the 
      ability to inject venom into the skin. Most people present only with local or 
      regional inflammatory response, and symptomatic treatment is usually effective. Even 
      so, individuals with hypersensitivity to bee venom may develop anaphylaxis. Several 
      marine species in the Portuguese coast are venomous to humans, including weeverfish 
      (Trachinidae family), stingrays (Dasyatis pastinaca, Taeniura grabata, Myliobatis 
      aquila), red scorpion fish (Scorpaena scrofa), cnidaria (Pelagia noctiluca, 
      Chrysaora hysoscella, Physalia physalis) and bearded fireworm (Hermodice 
      carunculata); treatment is symptomatic. Contact with the larvae or bristles 
      (chitinous structures with locomotor or tactile functions) of Thaumetopoea 
      pityocampa (pine processionary) can cause cutaneous, ocular and, rarely, respiratory 
      reactions; its management is also symptomatic.

TI  - Modulation of membrane phospholipids, the cytosolic calcium influx and cell

      from Loxosceles intermedia (brown spider) venom.

AB  - The mechanism through which brown spiders (Loxosceles genus) cause dermonecrosis, 
      dysregulated inflammatory responses, hemolysis and platelet aggregation, which are 
      effects reported following spider bites, is currently attributed to the presence of 
      phospholipase-D in the venom. In the present investigation, through two-dimensional 
      immunoblotting, we observed immunological cross-reactivity for at least 25 spots in 
      crude Loxosceles intermedia venom, indicating high expression levels for different 
      isoforms of phospholipase-D. Using a recombinant phospholipase-D from the venom 
      gland of L. intermedia (LiRecDT1) in phospholipid-degrading kinetic experiments, we 
      determined that this phospholipase-D mainly hydrolyzes synthetic sphingomyelin in a 
      time-dependent manner, generating ceramide 1-phosphate plus choline, as well as 
      lysophosphatidylcholine, generating lysophosphatidic acid plus choline, but exhibits 
      little activity against phosphatidylcholine. Through immunofluorescence assays with 
      antibodies against LiRecDT1 and using a recombinant GFP-LiRecDT1 fusion protein, we 
      observed direct binding of LiRecDT1 to the membrane of B16-F10 cells. We determined 
      that LiRecDT1 hydrolyzes phospholipids in detergent extracts and from ghosts of 
      B16-F10 cells, generating choline, indicating that the enzyme can access and 
      modulate and has activity against membrane phospholipids. Additionally, using 
      Fluo-4, a calcium-sensitive fluorophore, it was shown that treatment of cells with 
      phospholipase-D induced an increase in the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm, 
      but without altering viability or causing damage to cells. Finally, based on the 
      known endogenous activity of phospholipase-D as an inducer of cell proliferation and 
      the fact that LiRecDT1 binds to the cell surface, hydrolyzing phospholipids to 
      generate bioactive lipids, we employed LiRecDT1 as an exogenous source of 
      phospholipase-D in B16-F10 cells. Treatment of the cells was effective in increasing 
      their proliferation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, especially in the 
      presence of synthetic sphingomyelin in the medium. The results described herein 
      indicate the ability of brown spider phospholipase-D to induce the generation of 
      bioactive phospholipids, calcium influx into the cytoplasm and cell proliferation, 
      suggesting that this molecule can be used as a bioactive tool for experimental 
      protocols in cell biology.

AB  - Orb-weaving spiders use a highly strong, sticky and elastic web to catch their prey. 
      These web properties alone would be enough for the entrapment of prey; however, 
      these spiders may be hiding venomous secrets in the web, which current research is 
      revealing. Here, we provide strong proteotranscriptomic evidence for the presence of 
      toxin/neurotoxin-like proteins, defensins, and proteolytic enzymes on the web silk 
      from Nephila clavipes spider. The results from quantitative-based transcriptomic and 
      proteomic approaches showed that silk-producing glands produce an extensive 
      repertoire of toxin/neurotoxin-like proteins, similar to those already reported in 
      spider venoms. Meanwhile, the insect toxicity results demonstrated that these toxic 
      components can be lethal and/or paralytic chemical weapons used for prey capture on 
      the web, and the presence of fatty acids in the web may be a responsible mechanism 
      opening the way to the web toxins for accessing the interior of prey's body, as 
      shown here. Comparative phylogenomic-level evolutionary analyses revealed 
      orthologous genes among two spider groups, Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae, and the 
      findings showed protein sequences similar to toxins found in the taxa Scorpiones and 
      Hymenoptera in addition to Araneae. Overall, these data represent a valuable 
      resource to further investigate other spider web toxin systems and also suggest that 
      N. clavipes web is not a passive mechanical trap for prey capture, but it exerts an 
      active role in prey paralysis/killing using a series of neurotoxins.

AB  - Envenoming resulting from Loxosceles spider bites (loxoscelism) is a recognized 
      public health problem in Brazil. However, the pathophysiology of loxoscelism caused 
      by L. similis bites, which is widespread in Brazil, remains poorly understood. In 
      the present work, the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq - Next Generation sequencing - NGS) of 
      the L. similis venom gland was performed to identify and analyze the sequences of 
      the key component phospholipase D. The sequences were aligned based on their 
      classical domains, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. In the bioinformatics 
      analysis, 23 complete sequences of phospholipase D proteins were found and 
      classified as Loxtox proteins, as they contained the characteristic domains of 
      phospholipase D: the active site, the Mg(2+)-binding domain, and the catalytic loop. 
      Three phospholipase D sequences with non-canonical domains were also found in this 
      work. They were analyzed separately and named PLDs from L. similis (PLD-Ls). This 
      study is the first to characterize phospholipase D sequences from Loxosceles spiders 
      by RNA-Seq. These results contribute new knowledge about the composition of 
      L. similis venom, revealing novel tools that could be used for pharmacological, 
      immunological, and biotechnological applications.

LID - 10.3390/toxins9120399 [doi]
LID - 399
AB  - This communication reports a further examination of venom gland transcripts and 
      venom composition of the Mexican scorpion Thorellius atrox using RNA-seq and tandem 
      mass spectrometry. The RNA-seq, which was performed with the Illumina protocol, 
      yielded more than 20,000 assembled transcripts. Following a database search and 
      annotation strategy, 160 transcripts were identified, potentially coding for venom 
      components. A novel sequence was identified that potentially codes for a peptide 
      with similarity to spider ω-agatoxins, which act on voltage-gated calcium channels, 
      not known before to exist in scorpion venoms. Analogous transcripts were found in 
      other scorpion species. They could represent members of a new scorpion toxin family, 
      here named omegascorpins. The mass fingerprint by LC-MS identified 135 individual 
      venom components, five of which matched with the theoretical masses of putative 
      peptides translated from the transcriptome. The LC-MS/MS de novo sequencing allowed 
      to reconstruct and identify 42 proteins encoded by assembled transcripts, thus 
      validating the transcriptome analysis. Earlier studies conducted with this scorpion 
      venom permitted the identification of only twenty putative venom components. The 
      present work performed with more powerful and modern omic technologies demonstrates 
      the capacity of accomplishing a deeper characterization of scorpion venom components 
      and the identification of novel molecules with potential applications in biomedicine 
      and the study of ion channel physiology.

AB  - Loxoscelism is a recognized public health problem in Brazil, but the venom from 
      Loxosceles similis, which is widespread in Brazil due to its adaptability to the 
      urban environment, remains poorly characterized. Loxtox is a family of phospholipase 
      D enzymes (PLDs), which are the major components of Loxosceles venom and are 
      responsible for the clinical effects of loxoscelism. Loxtox toxins correspond to 15% 
      of L. similis venom gland transcripts, but the Loxtox family of L. similis has yet 
      to be fully described. In this study, we cloned and functionally characterized 
      recLoxtox s1A and recLoxtox s11A. These recombinant toxins exhibited different in 
      vitro activities depending on pH, and recLoxtox s1A had more intense effects on 
      rabbit skin than did recLoxtox s11A in vivo. Both recombinant toxins were used in 
      immunization protocols, and mapping of their epitopes revealed different 
      immunological reactions for the produced immune serums. Additionally, polyclonal 
      antibodies raised against recLoxtox s1A had greater capacity to significantly reduce 
      the in vitro and in vivo effects of L. similis venom. In summary, we obtained and 
      characterized two novel Loxtox isoforms from L. similis venom, which may be valuable 
      biotechnological and immunological tools against loxoscelism.

TI  - Molecular cloning and in silico characterization of knottin peptide, U2-SCRTX-Lit2, 
      from brown spider (Loxosceles intermedia) venom glands.
PG  - 196
LID - 10.1007/s00894-016-3067-0 [doi]
AB  - Inhibitor cystine knots (ICKs) are a family of structural peptides with a large 
      number of cysteine residues that form intramolecular disulfide bonds, resulting in a 
      knot. These peptides are involved in a variety of biological functions including 
      predation and defense, and are found in various species, such as spiders, scorpions, 
      sea anemones, and plants. The Loxosceles intermedia venom gland transcriptome 
      identified five groups of ICK peptides that represent more than 50 % of toxin-coding 
      transcripts. Here, we describe the molecular cloning of U2-Sicaritoxin-Lit2 
      (U2-SCRTX-Lit2), bioinformatic characterization, structure prediction, and molecular 
      dynamic analysis. The sequence of U2-SCRTX-Lit2 obtained from the transcriptome is 
      similar to that of μ-Hexatoxin-Mg2, a peptide that inhibits the insect Nav channel. 
      Bioinformatic analysis of sequences classified as ICK family members also showed a 
      conservation of cysteine residues among ICKs from different spiders, with the three 
      dimensional molecular model of U2-SCRTX-Lit2 similar in structure to the hexatoxin 
      from μ-hexatoxin-Mg2a. Molecular docking experiments showed the interaction of 
      U2-SCRTX-Lit2 to its predictable target-the Spodoptera litura voltage-gated sodium 
      channel (SlNaVSC). After 200 ns of molecular dynamic simulation, the final structure 
      of the complex showed stability in agreement with the experimental data. The above 
      analysis corroborates the existence of a peptide toxin with insecticidal activity 
      from a novel ICK family in L. intermedia venom and demonstrates that this peptide 
      targets Nav channels.

AB  - Theraphosidae spider venoms are well known for possess a complex mixture of protein 
      and non-protein compounds in their venom. The objective of this study was to report 
      and identify different proteins translated from the venom gland DNA information of 
      the recently described Theraphosidae spider Pamphobeteus verdolaga. Using a venom 
      gland transcriptomic analysis, we reported a set of the first complete sequences of 
      seven different proteins of the recenlty described Theraphosidae spider 
      P. verdolaga. Protein analysis indicates the presence of different proteins on the 
      venom composition of this new spider, some of them uncommon in the Theraphosidae 
      family. MS/MS analysis of P. verdolaga showed different fragments matching 
      sphingomyelinases (sicaritoxin), barytoxins, hexatoxins, latroinsectotoxins, and 
      linear (zadotoxins) peptides. Only four of the MS/MS fragments showed 100% sequence 
      similarity with one of the transcribed proteins. Transcriptomic analysis showed the 
      presence of different groups of proteins like phospholipases, hyaluronidases, 
      inhibitory cysteine knots (ICK) peptides among others. The three database of protein 
      domains used in this study (Pfam, SMART and CDD) showed congruency in the search of 
      unique conserved protein domain for only four of the translated proteins. Those 
      proteins matched with EF-hand proteins, cysteine rich secretory proteins, 
      jingzhaotoxins, theraphotoxins and hexatoxins, from different Mygalomorphae spiders 
      belonging to the families Theraphosidae, Barychelidae and Hexathelidae. None of the 
      analyzed sequences showed a complete 100% similarity.

AB  - Hadogenes is a genus of large African scorpions with 18 described species. However, 
      little is known about the venom peptide composition of any species from Hadogenes so 
      far. Here, we fully explored the composition of venom gland peptides from Hadogenes 
      troglodytes using transcriptomic approach. We discovered 121 novel peptides from the 
      scorpion, including 20 new-type peptides cross-linked with one, two, three, four or 
      seven disulfide bridges, respectively, 11 novel K(+)-channel toxin-like peptides, 2 
      novel ryanodine receptors-specific toxin-like peptides, a unique peptide containing 
      the cysteine knots of spider toxins, 15 novel La1-like toxins, 3 novel TIL 
      domain-containing peptides, 5 novel peptides with atypical cysteine patterns, 19 
      novel antimicrobial peptides, 6 novel cysteine-free peptides and 39 new-type 
      cysteine-free peptides. Among them, the new-type peptides are largely dominant; this 
      highlights the unique diversity of the venom gland peptides from H. troglodytes. 
      Some of the new peptides would serve as new molecular probes for the investigations 
      of cellular ion channels and other receptors, or offer new templates for the 
      development of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of ion channel-associated 
      diseases, and infections caused by antibiotics-resistant pathogens. BIOLOGICAL 
      SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we fully explored the composition of venom gland 
      peptides from the scorpion Hadogenes troglodytes using transcriptomic approach. We 
      discovered a total of 121 novel peptides from the venom glands of the scorpion, of 
      which new-type peptides are largely dominant. These data highlight the unique 
      diversity of the venom gland peptides from the scorpion H. troglodytes, gain 
      insights into new mechanisms for the scorpion to subdue its prey and predators, and 
      enlarge the protein database of scorpion venom glands. The discovery of a lot of 
      novel peptides provides new templates for the development of therapeutic drugs, and 
      offers new molecular materials for the basic researches of various cellular 
      receptors, and for the evolutionary investigations of scorpion toxins.

TI  - Evidence of positive selection on six spider developmental genes.
LID - 10.1002/jez.b.23119 [doi]
AB  - Spiders constitute more than 49,000 described species distributed all over the 
      world, and all ecological environments. Their order, Araneae, is defined by a set of 
      characteristics with no parallel among their arachnid counterparts (e.g., 
      spinnerets, silk glands, chelicerae that inoculate venom, among others). Changes in 
      developmental pathways often underlie the evolution of morphological synapomorphies, 
      and as such spiders are a promising model to study the role of developmental genes 
      in the origin of evolutionary novelties. With that in mind, we investigated changes 
      in the evolutionary regime of a set of six developmental genes, using spiders as our 
      model. The genes were mainly chosen for their roles in spinneret ontogeny, yet they 
      are pleiotropic, and it is likely that the origins of other unique morphological 
      phenotypes are also linked to changes in their sequences. Our results indicate no 
      great differences in the selective pressures on those genes when comparing spiders 
      to other arachnids, but a few site-specific positive selection evidence were found 
      in the Araneae lineage. These findings lead us to new insights on spider evolution 
      that are to be further tested.

TI  - Molecular basis and mechanism underlying the insecticidal activity of venoms and 
      toxins from Latrodectus spiders.

AB  - Latrodectus species are among the most venomous of spiders, with abundant toxic 
      proteinaceous components in their venomous glands and other tissues, as well as 
      their eggs. To date, several proteinaceous toxins with insecticidal potential, 
      including α-insectotoxin and δ-insectotoxin, two of the most potent known 
      insecticidal toxins, have been purified and characterized by comprehensively 
      utilizing conventional biochemical techniques. This has greatly enhanced our 
      knowledge of the molecular basis and mechanism of action of their toxicity. 
      Application of proteomic and transcriptomic techniques further revealed the 
      synergistic action of multiple Latrodectus proteinaceous toxins and toxin-like 
      components. Insecticidal toxins from Latrodectus spiders have great potential in 
      insect pest control; however, more studies are needed to further reveal their 
      mechanisms of action and understand their structures and properties before any 
      practical application, for example, the insecticidal toxin-containing fusion 
      proteins with oral activity. Here, we review current knowledge of the molecular 
      basis and mechanism of action underlying the insecticidal activity of venoms and 
      toxins from Latrodectus spiders, and examine their potential application in insect 
      pest control. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - ArachnoServer 3.0: an online resource for automated discovery, analysis and 
      annotation of spider toxins.
PG  - 1074-1076
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btx661 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: ArachnoServer is a manually curated database that consolidates information 
      on the sequence, structure, function and pharmacology of spider-venom toxins. 
      Although spider venoms are complex chemical arsenals, the primary constituents are 
      small disulfide-bridged peptides that target neuronal ion channels and receptors. 
      Due to their high potency and selectivity, these peptides have been developed as 
      pharmacological tools, bioinsecticides and drug leads. A new version of 
      ArachnoServer (v3.0) has been developed that includes a bioinformatics pipeline for 
      automated detection and analysis of peptide toxin transcripts in assembled 
      venom-gland transcriptomes. ArachnoServer v3.0 was updated with the latest sequence, 
      structure and functional data, the search-by-mass feature has been enhanced, and 
      toxin cards provide additional information about each mature toxin. AVAILABILITY AND 
      IMPLEMENTATION: http://arachnoserver.org. CONTACT: support@arachnoserver.org.

AB  - A transcriptome analysis of the venom glands of the spider Loxosceles laeta, 
      performed by our group, in a previous study (Fernandes-Pedrosa et al., 2008), 
      revealed a transcript with a sequence similar to the human complement component C3. 
      Here we present the analysis of this transcript. cDNA fragments encoding the C3 
      homologue (Lox-C3) were amplified from total RNA isolated from the venom glands of 
      L. laeta by RACE-PCR. Lox-C3 is a 5178 bps cDNA sequence encoding a 190kDa protein, 
      with a domain configuration similar to human C3. Multiple alignments of C3-like 
      proteins revealed two processing sites, suggesting that Lox-C3 is composed of three 
      chains. Furthermore, the amino acids consensus sequences for the thioester was 
      found, in addition to putative sequences responsible for FB binding. The 
      phylogenetic analysis showed that Lox-C3 belongs to the same group as two C3 
      isoforms from the spider Hasarius adansoni (Family Salcitidae), showing 53% homology 
      with these. This is the first characterization of a Loxosceles cDNA sequence 
      encoding a human C3 homologue, and this finding, together with our previous finding 
      of the expression of a FB-like molecule, suggests that this spider species also has 
      a complement system. This work will help to improve our understanding of the innate 
      immune system in these spiders and the ancestral structure of C3.

AB  - Peptides isolated from spider venoms are of pharmacological interest due to their 
      neurotoxic activity, acting on voltage-dependent ion channels present in different 
      types of human body tissues. Three peptide toxins titled as Ap2, Ap3 and Ap5 were 
      purified by RP-HPLC from Acanthoscurria paulensis venom. They were partially 
      sequenced by MALDI In-source Decay method and their sequences were completed and 
      confirmed by transcriptome analysis of the venom gland. The Ap2, Ap3 and Ap5 
      peptides have, respectively, 42, 41 and 46 amino acid residues, and experimental 
      molecular masses of 4886.3, 4883.7 and 5454.7 Da, with the Ap2 peptide presenting an 
      amidated C-terminus. Amongst the assayed channels - NaV1.1, NaV1.5, NaV1.7, CaV1.2, 
      CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 - Ap2, Ap3 and Ap5 inhibited 20-30 % of CaV2.1 current at 1 μM 
      concentration. Ap3 also inhibited sodium current in NaV1.1, Nav1.5 and Nav1.7 
      channels by 6.6 ± 1.91 % (p = 0.0276), 4.2 ± 1.09 % (p = 0.0185) and 16.05 ± 2.75 % 
      (p = 0.0282), respectively. Considering that Ap2, Ap3 and Ap5 belong to the 
      'U'-unknown family of spider toxins, which has few descriptions of biological 
      activity, the present work contributes to the knowledge of these peptides and 
      demonstrates this potential as channel modulators.

TI  - Australian funnel-web spiders evolved human-lethal δ-hexatoxins for defense against 
      vertebrate predators.
PG  - 24920-24928
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2004516117 [doi]
AB  - Australian funnel-web spiders are infamous for causing human fatalities, which are 
      induced by venom peptides known as δ-hexatoxins (δ-HXTXs). Humans and other primates 
      did not feature in the prey or predator spectrum during evolution of these spiders, 
      and consequently the primate lethality of δ-HXTXs remains enigmatic. Funnel-web 
      envenomations are mostly inflicted by male spiders that wander from their burrow in 
      search of females during the mating season, which suggests a role for δ-HXTXs in 
      self-defense since male spiders rarely feed during this period. Although 35 species 
      of Australian funnel-web spiders have been described, only nine δ-HXTXs from four 
      species have been characterized, resulting in a lack of understanding of the 
      ecological roles and molecular evolution of δ-HXTXs. Here, by profiling venom-gland 
      transcriptomes of 10 funnel-web species, we report 22 δ-HXTXs. Phylogenetic and 
      evolutionary assessments reveal a remarkable sequence conservation of δ-HXTXs 
      despite their deep evolutionary origin within funnel-web spiders, consistent with a 
      defensive role. We demonstrate that δ-HXTX-Ar1a, the lethal toxin from the Sydney 
      funnel-web spider Atrax robustus, induces pain in mice by inhibiting inactivation of 
      voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channels involved in nociceptive signaling. δ-HXTX-Ar1a 
      also inhibited inactivation of cockroach Na(V) channels and was insecticidal to 
      sheep blowflies. Considering their algogenic effects in mice, potent insecticidal 
      effects, and high levels of sequence conservation, we propose that the δ-HXTXs were 
      repurposed from an initial insecticidal predatory function to a role in defending 
      against nonhuman vertebrate predators by male spiders, with their lethal effects on 
      humans being an unfortunate evolutionary coincidence.

TI  - Intragenome Diversity of Gene Families Encoding Toxin-like Proteins in Venomous 
      Animals.
PG  - 938-949
AB  - The evolution of venoms is the story of how toxins arise and of the processes that 
      generate and maintain their diversity. For animal venoms these processes include 
      recruitment for expression in the venom gland, neofunctionalization, paralogous 
      expansions, and functional divergence. The systematic study of these processes 
      requires the reliable identification of the venom components involved in 
      antagonistic interactions. High-throughput sequencing has the potential of 
      uncovering the entire set of toxins in a given organism, yet the existence of 
      non-venom toxin paralogs and the misleading effects of partial census of the 
      molecular diversity of toxins make necessary to collect complementary evidence to 
      distinguish true toxins from their non-venom paralogs. Here, we analyzed the whole 
      genomes of two scorpions, one spider and one snake, aiming at the identification of 
      the full repertoires of genes encoding toxin-like proteins. We classified the entire 
      set of protein-coding genes into paralogous groups and monotypic genes, identified 
      genes encoding toxin-like proteins based on known toxin families, and quantified 
      their expression in both venom-glands and pooled tissues. Our results confirm that 
      genes encoding toxin-like proteins are part of multigene families, and that these 
      families arise by recruitment events from non-toxin genes followed by limited 
      expansions of the toxin-like protein coding genes. We also show that failing to 
      account for sequence similarity with non-toxin proteins has a considerable 
      misleading effect that can be greatly reduced by comparative transcriptomics. Our 
      study overall contributes to the understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of 
      proteins involved in antagonistic interactions.

TI  - A comparison between the recombinant expression and chemical synthesis of a short 
      cysteine-rich insecticidal spider peptide.
PG  - 19

LID - 19
AB  - BACKGROUND: The choice between heterologous expression versus chemical synthesis for 
      synthesizing short cysteine-rich insecticidal peptides from arthropods may impact 
      the obtainment of yields and well-folded bioactive molecules for scientific 
      research. Therefore, two recombinant expression systems were compared to that of 
      chemical synthesis for producing Ba1, a cysteine-rich spider neurotoxin. METHODS: 
      The transcription of the insecticidal neurotoxin Ba1 was obtained from a cDNA 
      library of venom glands of the spider Brachypelma albiceps. It was cloned into the 
      pCR®2.1-TOPO® cloning vector and then introduced in two different expression 
      vectors, pQE40 and pET28a(+). Each vector was transfected into E. coli M15 and BL21 
      cells, respectively, and expressed under induction with isopropyl thiogalactoside 
      (IPTG). The chemical synthesis of Ba1 was performed in an Applied Biosystems 433A 
      peptide synthesizer. RESULTS: Both expression systems pQE40 and pET28a(+) expressed 
      the His-tagged recombinant protein products, HisrDFHRBa1 and HisrBa1, respectively, 
      as inclusion bodies. The recombinant proteins HisrDFHRBa1 and HisrBa1 presented 
      respective molecular masses of 28,289 and 8274.6 Da, and were not biologically 
      active. These results suggested that both HisrDFHRBa1 and HisrBa1 were oxidized 
      after cell extraction, and that their insecticidal activities were affected by their 
      N-terminal pro-peptides and different disulfide bridge arrangements. The respective 
      protein expression yields for HisrDFHRBa1 and HisrBa1 were 100 μg/L and 900 μg/L of 
      culture medium. HisrBa1 was reduced and folded under in vitro conditions. The in 
      vitro folding of HisrBa1 produced several isoforms, one of which, after removing its 
      N-terminal pro-peptide by enzymatic cleavage, presented elevated insecticidal 
      activities compared to the native Ba1. Furthermore, the His-tagged protein 
      HisrDFHRBa1 underwent enzymatic cleavage to obtain recombinant Ba1 (rBa1). As 
      expected, the molecular mass of rBa1 was 4406.4 Da. On the other hand, Ba1 was 
      chemically synthesized (sBa1) with a yield of 11 mg per 0.1 mmol of amino acid 
      assembly. CONCLUSIONS: The two recombinant insecticidal peptides and the one 
      synthesized chemically were as active as the native Ba1; however, toxin yields 
      differed drastically.

TI  - Spider phylosymbiosis: divergence of widow spider species and their tissues' 
      microbiomes.
PG  - 104
LID - 10.1186/s12862-020-01664-x [doi]
LID - 104
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiomes can have profound impacts on host biology and evolution, but 
      to date, remain vastly understudied in spiders despite their unique and diverse 
      predatory adaptations. This study evaluates closely related species of spiders and 
      their host-microbe relationships in the context of phylosymbiosis, an 
      eco-evolutionary pattern where the microbial community profile parallels the 
      phylogeny of closely related host species. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, 
      we characterized the microbiomes of five species with known phylogenetic 
      relationships from the family Theridiidae, including multiple closely related widow 
      spiders (L. hesperus, L. mactans, L. geometricus, S. grossa, and P. tepidariorum). 
      RESULTS: We compared whole animal and tissue-specific microbiomes (cephalothorax, 
      fat bodies, venom glands, silk glands, and ovary) in the five species to better 
      understand the relationship between spiders and their microbial symbionts. This 
      showed a strong congruence of the microbiome beta-diversity of the whole spiders, 
      cephalothorax, venom glands, and silk glands when compared to their host phylogeny. 
      Our results support phylosymbiosis in these species and across their specialized 
      tissues. The ovary tissue microbial dendrograms also parallel the widow phylogeny, 
      suggesting vertical transfer of species-specific bacterial symbionts. By 
      cross-validating with RNA sequencing data obtained from the venom glands, silk 
      glands and ovaries of L. hesperus, L. geometricus, S. grossa, and P. tepidariorum we 
      confirmed that several microbial symbionts of interest are viably active in the 
      host. CONCLUSION: Together these results provide evidence that supports the 
      importance of host-microbe interactions and the significant role microbial 
      communities may play in the evolution and adaptation of their hosts.

AB  - One of the distinct characters of Latrodectus tredecimguttatus is that its toxic 
      components exist not only in the venomous glands, but also in the tissues outside 
      the venomous glands and even in the eggs. Investigation on the toxins outside the 
      venomous glands can deepen our understanding of spider toxins and discover new lead 
      molecules with important application prospects. In order to explore the 
      low-abundance proteinaceous toxins in the L. tredecimguttatus eggs, we used 
      bioinformatic strategies to mine a gene sequence encoding a peptide toxin from the 
      transcriptome of L. tredecimguttatus eggs, and then heterologously expressed the 
      gene successfully with a 3'-RACE combined with nest PCR strategy. Biological 
      activity analyses indicated that the expressed peptide toxin, named latroeggtoxin-Ⅵ 
      (LETX-Ⅵ), could inhibit Na⁺ channel currents in ND7/23 cells and promote dopamine 
      release from PC12 cells, without obvious toxicity against Periplaneta americana and 
      bacteria as well as fungi including Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, 
      demonstrating that LETX-Ⅵ is a mammal-specific neurotoxin with a potential 
      application prospect in development of the tool reagents for neurobiological study 
      and the drugs for treating related diseases.

AB  - Neuropeptides have been successfully documented in numerous arthropod species via in 
      silico prediction from transcriptomic and genomic data. We recently sequenced the 
      genome and nine transcriptomes of a chelicerate species, the pond wolf spider, 
      Pardosa pseudoannulata. Here 43 neuropeptide families encoded by 87 neuropeptide 
      genes were identified, among which 84 genes were presented with complete open 
      reading frames. The neuropeptide genes often had paralogs and paralogous genes 
      showed different expression profiles in nine transcriptomes. Six crustacean 
      hyperglycemic hormone/ion transport peptide-like (CHH/ITP) genes were predicted and 
      CHH/ITP6 was expressed much higher than the others. Orcokinin 1 and orcokinin 2 
      genes were both expressed in brain at a similar level. But, interestingly, orcokinin 
      1 gene was ubiquitously expressed in appendages while orcokinin 2 gene was enriched 
      in venom gland to an extreme extent. The expression profiling of neuropeptide genes 
      offers clues for further functional investigation. Paralogous genes were also found 
      to be clustered at scaffolds such as nine insulin-like peptide genes at three 
      scaffolds and six pyrokinin genes at two scaffolds, indicating a result of local 
      gene duplication. In contrast, the four C-type allatostatin family members were 
      scattered at five scaffolds, different from their closely associated locations 
      reported in many arthropod species including several spiders. The comprehensive 
      inventory of P. pseudoannulata neuropeptides here expands our repository of 
      chelicerate neuropeptides and further promotes our understanding of neuropeptide 
      evolution and functions.

TI  - SVM-based prediction of propeptide cleavage sites in spider toxins identifies toxin 
      innovation in an Australian tarantula.

AB  - Spider neurotoxins are commonly used as pharmacological tools and are a popular 
      source of novel compounds with therapeutic and agrochemical potential. Since venom 
      peptides are inherently toxic, the host spider must employ strategies to avoid 
      adverse effects prior to venom use. It is partly for this reason that most spider 
      toxins encode a protective proregion that upon enzymatic cleavage is excised from 
      the mature peptide. In order to identify the mature toxin sequence directly from 
      toxin transcripts, without resorting to protein sequencing, the propeptide cleavage 
      site in the toxin precursor must be predicted bioinformatically. We evaluated 
      different machine learning strategies (support vector machines, hidden Markov model 
      and decision tree) and developed an algorithm (SpiderP) for prediction of propeptide 
      cleavage sites in spider toxins. Our strategy uses a support vector machine (SVM) 
      framework that combines both local and global sequence information. Our method is 
      superior or comparable to current tools for prediction of propeptide sequences in 
      spider toxins. Evaluation of the SVM method on an independent test set of known 
      toxin sequences yielded 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Furthermore, we 
      sequenced five novel peptides (not used to train the final predictor) from the venom 
      of the Australian tarantula Selenotypus plumipes to test the accuracy of the 
      predictor and found 80% sensitivity and 99.6% 8-mer specificity. Finally, we used 
      the predictor together with homology information to predict and characterize seven 
      groups of novel toxins from the deeply sequenced venom gland transcriptome of S. 
      plumipes, which revealed structural complexity and innovations in the evolution of 
      the toxins. The precursor prediction tool (SpiderP) is freely available on 
      ArachnoServer (http://www.arachnoserver.org/spiderP.html), a web portal to a 
      comprehensive relational database of spider toxins. All training data, test data, 
      and scripts used are available from the SpiderP website.

TI  - Antibacterial and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Novel Peptide Toxin from the Spider 
      Pardosa astrigera.
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics9070422 [doi]
LID - 422
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become an immediate threat to 
      public health. Antimicrobial peptides are attracting attention as a new source of 
      antibiotics due to their ability to prevent drug-resistances with fewer side 
      effects. Spider venom is composed of various bioactive substances with multiple 
      functionalities such as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, RNA 
      sequencing was conducted on the venom gland of the spider Pardosa astrigera, and a 
      potential toxin peptide with antibacterial properties was selected via homology and 
      in silico analysis. A novel toxin, Lycotoxin-Pa4a, inhibited both gram-negative and 
      gram-positive bacteria by disrupting the outer and bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. 
      Moreover, the peptide downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators 
      while upregulating the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine by inactivating 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in a lipopolysaccharide-stimulated murine 
      macrophage cell line. In this research, we identified a novel peptide toxin, 
      Lycotoxin-pa4a, with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting its 
      potential for the development of a new antibiotics, as well as offering insights 
      into the utilization of biological resources.

TI  - Plectreurys tristis venome: A proteomic and transcriptomic analysis.
PG  - 33-47
AB  - Spider venoms are complex cocktails rich in peptides, proteins and organic molecules 
      that collectively act to immobilize prey. Venoms of the primitive hunting spider, 
      Plectreurys tristis, have numerous neurotoxic peptides called "plectoxins" (PLTX), a 
      unique acylpolyamine called bis(agmatine)oxalamide, and larger unidentified protein 
      components. These spiders also have unconventional multi-lobed venom glands. 
      Inspired by these unusual characteristics and their phylogenetic position as 
      Haplogynes, we have partially characterized the venome of P. tristis using combined 
      transcriptomic and proteomic methods. With these analyses we found known venom 
      neurotoxins U1-PLTX-Pt1a, U3-PLTX-Pt1a, and we discovered new groups of potential 
      neurotoxins, expanding the U1- and ω-PLTX families and adding U4-through U9-PLTX as 
      six new groups. The venom also contains proteins that are homologs of astacin 
      metalloproteases that, combined with venom peptides, make up 94% of components 
      detected in crude venom, while the remaining 6% is a single undescribed protein with 
      unknown function. Other proteins detected in the transcriptome were found to be 
      members of conserved gene families and make up 20% of the transcripts. These include 
      cDNA sequences that match venom proteins from Mesobuthus and Hottentotta scorpions, 
      Loxosceles and Dysdera spiders, and also salivary and secreted peptide sequences 
      from Ixodes, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus ticks. Finally, we show that crude venom 
      has neurotoxic effects and an effective paralytic dose on crickets of 3.3µg/gm.

TI  - Melatonin promotes regeneration of injured motor axons via MT(1) receptors.
PG  - e12695
LID - 10.1111/jpi.12695 [doi]
LID - e12695
AB  - Melatonin is an ancient multi-tasking molecule produced by the pineal gland and by 
      several extrapineal tissues. A variety of activities has been ascribed to this 
      hormone in different physiological and pathological contexts, but little is known 
      about its role in peripheral neuroregeneration. Here, we have exploited two 
      different types of injury to test the capability of melatonin to stimulate 
      regeneration of motor axons: (a) the acute and reversible presynaptic degeneration 
      induced by the spider neurotoxin α-Latrotoxin and (b) the compression/transection of 
      the sciatic nerve. We found that in both cases melatonin administration accelerates 
      the process of nerve repair. This pro-regenerative action is MT(1) -mediated, and at 
      least in part due to a sustained activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. These findings 
      reveal a receptor-mediated, pro-regenerative action of melatonin in vivo that holds 
      important clinical implications, as it posits melatonin as a safe candidate molecule 
      for the treatment of a number of peripheral neurodegenerative conditions.

      toxins].
PG  - 1036-43
AB  - Latrodectus tredecimguttatus (commonly known as black widow spiders) have toxins not 
      only in their venom glands, but also in other parts of their body, in their eggs and 
      even in the newborn spiderlings. The study on the toxins in venom and materials 
      outside the venom glands of the spiders to elucidate their differences and 
      similarities, evolutional relationship and biological functions is of important 
      theoretical and applicable significance. The development of modern protein chemistry 
      and proteomics techniques has provided efficient means for the study of protein and 
      peptide toxins of L. tredecimguttatus. By using such techniques, the molecular base 
      and action mechanism of the toxins can be revealed at the levels of both single 
      purified proteins and omics. Up to now, although protein chemistry and proteomics 
      study on L. tredecimguttatus toxins have achieved a certain progress, the relevant 
      work particularly that on the toxins in the materials outside the venom glands has 
      to be further deepened.

AB  - In the last decades, main advances were achieved in the identification, structural 
      and pharmacological characterization of Phoneutria nigriventer toxins. However, 
      studies on the venom-producing apparatus are rare. Presently, we applied 
      immunolabeling to historesin-embedded cross-sections of P. nigriventer venom glands. 
      Toxins and toxin-secreting cells were successfully located in situ, using laser 
      confocal scanning microscopy. The methodological strategy was successful and may be 
      applied in future studies on venom glands and other secreting tissues, in general.

TI  - A Multiomics Approach Unravels New Toxins With Possible In Silico Antimicrobial, 
      Antiviral, and Antitumoral Activities in the Venom of Acanthoscurria rondoniae.

AB  - The Araneae order is considered one of the most successful groups among venomous 
      animals in the world. An important factor for this success is the production of 
      venoms, a refined biological fluid rich in proteins, short peptides and 
      cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs). These toxins may present pharmacologically relevant 
      biological actions, as antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer activities, for 
      instance. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in the exploration of venom 
      toxins for therapeutic reasons, such as drug development. However, the process of 
      peptide sequencing and mainly the evaluation of potential biological activities of 
      these peptides are laborious, considering the low yield of venom extraction and the 
      high variability of toxins present in spider venoms. Here we show a robust 
      methodology for identification, sequencing, and initial screening of potential 
      bioactive peptides found in the venom of Acanthoscurria rondoniae. This methodology 
      consists in a multiomics approach involving proteomics, peptidomics and 
      transcriptomics analyses allied to in silico predictions of antibacterial, 
      antifungal, antiviral, and anticancer activities. Through the application of this 
      strategy, a total of 92,889 venom gland transcripts were assembled and 84 novel 
      toxins were identified at the protein level, including seven short peptides and 10 
      fully sequenced CRPs (belonging to seven toxin families). In silico analysis 
      suggests that seven CRPs families may have potential antimicrobial or antiviral 
      activities, while two CRPs and four short peptides are potentially anticancer. Taken 
      together, our results demonstrate an effective multiomics strategy for the discovery 
      of new toxins and in silico screening of potential bioactivities. This strategy may 
      be useful in toxin discovery, as well as in the screening of possible activities for 
      the vast diversity of molecules produced by venomous animals.

AB  - We investigated the peptide inventory of the corpora cardiaca (CC) of the honey bee, 
      Apis mellifera, by direct tissue profiling using MALDI-TOF MS combined with 
      proteomic approaches focusing on cysteine-containing peptides. An agatoxin-like 
      peptide (ALP) was identified as a component of the glandular part of the CC and was 
      associated with the presence of the adipokinetic hormone in mass spectra. Although 
      abundant in the CC, ALP does not belong to the toxins observed in the venom gland of 
      A. mellifera. Homologs of ALP are highly conserved in major groups of arthropods and 
      in line with this we detected ALP in the CC of non-venomous insects such as 
      cockroaches and silverfish. In the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, ALP 
      was also identified in the CNS and stomatogastric nervous system. This is the first 
      report that establishes the presence of ALPs in the neuroendocrine tissues of 
      insects and further studies are necessary to reveal common functions of these 
      peptides, e.g. as antimicrobial agents, ion channel modulators or classical 
      neuropeptides. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Among the messenger molecules of the nervous 
      system, neuropeptides represent the structurally most diverse class and basically 
      participate in the regulation of all physiological processes. The set of 
      neuropeptides, their functions and spatial distribution are particularly 
      well-studied in insects. Until now, however, several potential neuropeptide 
      receptors remained orphan, which indicates the existence of so far unknown ligands. 
      In our study, we used proteomic methods such as cysteine modification, enzymatic 
      digestion and peptide derivatization, combined with direct tissue profiling by 
      MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, for the discovery of novel putative messenger molecules 
      in the neuroendocrine system. The described presence of agatoxin-like peptides in 
      the nervous system of the honey bee and other insects was overseen so far and is 
      thus a remarkable addition to the very well studied neuropeptidome of insects. It is 
      not yet clear, if these toxin-like peptides act as antimicrobial agents, ion channel 
      modulators or classical neuropeptides.

TI  - Are Fireworms Venomous? Evidence for the Convergent Evolution of Toxin Homologs in 
      Three Species of Fireworms (Annelida, Amphinomidae).
PG  - 249-268
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evx279 [doi]
AB  - Amphinomids, more commonly known as fireworms, are a basal lineage of marine 
      annelids characterized by the presence of defensive dorsal calcareous chaetae, which 
      break off upon contact. It has long been hypothesized that amphinomids are venomous 
      and use the chaetae to inject a toxic substance. However, studies investigating 
      fireworm venom from a morphological or molecular perspective are scarce and no venom 
      gland has been identified to date, nor any toxin characterized at the molecular 
      level. To investigate this question, we analyzed the transcriptomes of three species 
      of fireworms-Eurythoe complanata, Hermodice carunculata, and Paramphinome 
      jeffreysii-following a venomics approach to identify putative venom compounds. Our 
      venomics pipeline involved de novo transcriptome assembly, open reading frame, and 
      signal sequence prediction, followed by three different homology search strategies: 
      BLAST, HMMER sequence, and HMMER domain. Following this pipeline, we identified 34 
      clusters of orthologous genes, representing 13 known toxin classes that have been 
      repeatedly recruited into animal venoms. Specifically, the three species share a 
      similar toxin profile with C-type lectins, peptidases, metalloproteinases, spider 
      toxins, and CAP proteins found among the most highly expressed toxin homologs. 
      Despite their great diversity, the putative toxins identified are predominantly 
      involved in three major biological processes: hemostasis, inflammatory response, and 
      allergic reactions, all of which are commonly disrupted after fireworm stings. 
      Although the putative fireworm toxins identified here need to be further validated, 
      our results strongly suggest that fireworms are venomous animals that use a complex 
      mixture of toxins for defense against predators.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spiders are known for their predatory efficiency and for their high 
      capacity of digesting relatively large prey. They do this by combining both 
      extracorporeal and intracellular digestion. Whereas many high throughput ("-omics") 
      techniques focus on biomolecules in spider venom, so far this approach has not yet 
      been applied to investigate the protein composition of spider midgut diverticula 
      (MD) and digestive fluid (DF). RESULTS: We here report on our investigations of both 
      MD and DF of the spider Nephilingis (Nephilengys) cruentata through the use of next 
      generation sequencing and shotgun proteomics. This shows that the DF is composed of 
      a variety of hydrolases including peptidases, carbohydrases, lipases and nuclease, 
      as well as of toxins and regulatory proteins. We detect 25 astacins in the DF. 
      Phylogenetic analysis of the corresponding transcript(s) in Arachnida suggests that 
      astacins have acquired an unprecedented role for extracorporeal digestion in 
      Araneae, with different orthologs used by each family. The results of a comparative 
      study of spiders in distinct physiological conditions allow us to propose some 
      digestion mechanisms in this interesting animal taxon. CONCLUSION: All the high 
      throughput data allowed the demonstration that DF is a secretion originating from 
      the MD. We identified enzymes involved in the extracellular and intracellular phases 
      of digestion. Besides that, data analyses show a large gene duplication event in 
      Araneae digestive process evolution, mainly of astacin genes. We were also able to 
      identify proteins expressed and translated in the digestive system, which until now 
      had been exclusively associated to venom glands.

TI  - Structural and Functional Diversity of Peptide Toxins from Tarantula Haplopelma 
      hainanum (Ornithoctonus hainana) Venom Revealed by Transcriptomic, Peptidomic, and 
      Patch Clamp Approaches.
PG  - 14192-207

AB  - Spider venom is a complex mixture of bioactive peptides to subdue their prey. Early 
      estimates suggested that over 400 venom peptides are produced per species. In order 
      to investigate the mechanisms responsible for this impressive diversity, 
      transcriptomics based on second generation high throughput sequencing was combined 
      with peptidomic assays to characterize the venom of the tarantula Haplopelma 
      hainanum. The genes expressed in the venom glands were identified, and the 
      bioactivity of their protein products was analyzed using the patch clamp technique. 
      A total of 1,136 potential toxin precursors were identified that clustered into 90 
      toxin groups, of which 72 were novel. The toxin peptides clustered into 20 cysteine 
      scaffolds that included between 4 and 12 cysteines, and 14 of these groups were 
      newly identified in this spider. Highly abundant toxin peptide transcripts were 
      present and resulted from hypermutation and/or fragment insertion/deletion. In 
      combination with variable post-translational modifications, this genetic variability 
      explained how a limited set of genes can generate hundreds of toxin peptides in 
      venom glands. Furthermore, the intraspecies venom variability illustrated the 
      dynamic nature of spider venom and revealed how complex components work together to 
      generate diverse bioactivities that facilitate adaptation to changing environments, 
      types of prey, and milking regimes in captivity.

TI  - Cytotoxic and apoptotic activities of black widow spiderling extract against HeLa 
      cells.
PG  - 3267-3274

AB  - Black widow spiders contain toxic components not only in the venom glands but also 
      in other parts of the spider body, including the legs and abdomen. Additionally, 
      both the eggs and newborn spiderlings of the black widow spider contain venom. It is 
      important to investigate their potential effects on cancer cells. In the present 
      study, the effects of newborn black widow spiderling extract on human HeLa cells 
      were evaluated in vitro. When applied at different concentrations, the total extract 
      decreased HeLa cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(50) value of 
      158 µg/ml. Flow cytometry indicated that treatment of HeLa cells with the total 
      extract of the spiderlings induced apoptosis in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent 
      manner and led to cell cycle arrest in the S-phase. Additionally, application of the 
      total extract at different concentrations increased apoptosis-related caspase 3 
      activity in a dose-dependent manner. HeLa cells treated with the total extract 
      appeared to be morphologically changed, exhibiting membrane blebbing, nuclear 
      fragmentation and condensation of chromatin. Further separation and activity 
      screening demonstrated that the cytotoxic and apoptotic activities of the total 
      extract were attributable mainly to its high molecular mass proteins, one of which 
      was purified and characterized to determine its anti-tumor activities on HeLa cells. 
      The results of the present study therefore have expanded understanding regarding the 
      effect of spider toxins on cancer cells and suggested that components of black widow 
      spiderlings may be developed as a promising novel agent to treat cancer.

AB  - Black widow venom contains α-latrotoxin, infamous for causing intense pain. 
      Combining 33 kb of Latrodectus hesperus genomic DNA with RNA-Seq, we characterized 
      the α-latrotoxin gene and discovered a paralog, 4.5 kb downstream. Both paralogs 
      exhibit venom gland specific transcription, and may be regulated 
      post-transcriptionally via mUSAhi-like proteins. A 4 kb intron interrupts the 
      α-latrotoxin coding sequence, while a 10 kb intron in the 3' UTR of the paralog may 
      cause non-sense-mediated decay. Phylogenetic analysis confirms these divergent 
      latrotoxins diversified through recent tandem gene duplications. Thus, latrotoxin 
      genes have more complex structures, regulatory controls, and sequence diversity than 
      previously proposed.

AB  - Bites evoked by Brown spiders (Loxosceles genus) are associated with skin injuries 
      (cutaneous rash, itching, swelling, erythema and dermonecrosis) and systemic 
      manifestations. Transcriptome analyses of Loxosceles venom glands showed that the 
      venom has a complex composition containing toxins such as phospholipases-D, 
      metalloproteases and hyaluronidases. Here, by screening the RNA from L. intermedia 
      venom glands, we cloned a novel allergen toxin, and named LALLT 
      (LoxoscelesAllergen-Like Toxin). Sequence analysis showed that LALLT is closely 
      related to allergens from other spiders and RNA screening indicated the presence of 
      LALLT orthologues in the venom of other Loxosceles spiders. Recombinant LALLT was 
      expressed (~45 kDa) in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified by affinity 
      chromatography. Antibodies against different Loxosceles venoms cross-reacted with 
      LALLT and antibodies against LALLT recognized three Loxosceles venoms, revealing 
      epitopes identity. LALLT triggered paw edema in mice and erythema, edema and 
      leukocyte infiltration into the dermis of rabbit skin. Also, LALLT induced vascular 
      permeability in mice, degranulation of rat mesentery mast cells, as well as prompted 
      degranulation and increased calcium influx in RBL-2H3 cells. Data reported suggest 
      for the first time the existence of allergens in Loxosceles venoms and make LALLT 
      available for clinical studies about allergenic events arisen by Loxosceles 
      envenoming.

TI  - The Rise and Fall of an Evolutionary Innovation: Contrasting Strategies of Venom 
      Evolution in Ancient and Young Animals.
PG  - e1005596
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005596 [doi]
LID - e1005596
AB  - Animal venoms are theorized to evolve under the significant influence of positive 
      Darwinian selection in a chemical arms race scenario, where the evolution of venom 
      resistance in prey and the invention of potent venom in the secreting animal exert 
      reciprocal selection pressures. Venom research to date has mainly focused on 
      evolutionarily younger lineages, such as snakes and cone snails, while mostly 
      neglecting ancient clades (e.g., cnidarians, coleoids, spiders and centipedes). By 
      examining genome, venom-gland transcriptome and sequences from the public 
      repositories, we report the molecular evolutionary regimes of several centipede and 
      spider toxin families, which surprisingly accumulated low-levels of sequence 
      variations, despite their long evolutionary histories. Molecular evolutionary 
      assessment of over 3500 nucleotide sequences from 85 toxin families spanning the 
      breadth of the animal kingdom has unraveled a contrasting evolutionary strategy 
      employed by ancient and evolutionarily young clades. We show that the venoms of 
      ancient lineages remarkably evolve under the heavy constraints of negative 
      selection, while toxin families in lineages that originated relatively recently 
      rapidly diversify under the influence of positive selection. We propose that animal 
      venoms mostly employ a 'two-speed' mode of evolution, where the major influence of 
      diversifying selection accompanies the earlier stages of ecological specialization 
      (e.g., diet and range expansion) in the evolutionary history of the species-the 
      period of expansion, resulting in the rapid diversification of the venom arsenal, 
      followed by longer periods of purifying selection that preserve the potent toxin 
      pharmacopeia-the period of purification and fixation. However, species in the period 
      of purification may re-enter the period of expansion upon experiencing a major shift 
      in ecology or environment. Thus, we highlight for the first time the significant 
      roles of purifying and episodic selections in shaping animal venoms.

TI  - The Nephila clavipes genome highlights the diversity of spider silk genes and their 
      complex expression.
PG  - 895-903
LID - 10.1038/ng.3852 [doi]
AB  - Spider silks are the toughest known biological materials, yet are lightweight and 
      virtually invisible to the human immune system, and they thus have revolutionary 
      potential for medicine and industry. Spider silks are largely composed of spidroins, 
      a unique family of structural proteins. To investigate spidroin genes 
      systematically, we constructed the first genome of an orb-weaving spider: the golden 
      orb-weaver (Nephila clavipes), which builds large webs using an extensive repertoire 
      of silks with diverse physical properties. We cataloged 28 Nephila spidroins, 
      representing all known orb-weaver spidroin types, and identified 394 repeated coding 
      motif variants and higher-order repetitive cassette structures unique to specific 
      spidroins. Characterization of spidroin expression in distinct silk gland types 
      indicates that glands can express multiple spidroin types. We find evidence of an 
      alternatively spliced spidroin, a spidroin expressed only in venom glands, 
      evolutionary mechanisms for spidroin diversification, and non-spidroin genes with 
      expression patterns that suggest roles in silk production.

      Sicarius dolichocephalus. These peptides were identified from cDNA libraries created 
      from venom gland mRNA and then recombinantly expressed. They are the first 
      structures from any species of Sicarius spiders, and the first peptide structures 
      for any haplogyne spiders. These peptides are homologous to one another, and while 
      they have at most only 20% sequence identity with known venom peptides their 
      structures follow the inhibitor cystine knot motif that has been found in a broad 
      range of venom peptides.

TI  - The first venomous crustacean revealed by transcriptomics and functional morphology: 
      remipede venom glands express a unique toxin cocktail dominated by enzymes and a 
      neurotoxin.
PG  - 48-58
LID - 10.1093/molbev/mst199 [doi]
AB  - Animal venoms have evolved many times. Venomous species are especially common in 
      three of the four main groups of arthropods (Chelicerata, Myriapoda, and Hexapoda), 
      which together represent tens of thousands of species of venomous spiders, 
      scorpions, centipedes, and hymenopterans. Surprisingly, despite their great 
      diversity of body plans, there is no unambiguous evidence that any crustacean is 
      venomous. We provide the first conclusive evidence that the aquatic, blind, and 
      cave-dwelling remipede crustaceans are venomous and that venoms evolved in all four 
      major arthropod groups. We produced a three-dimensional reconstruction of the venom 
      delivery apparatus of the remipede Speleonectes tulumensis, showing that remipedes 
      can inject venom in a controlled manner. A transcriptomic profile of its venom 
      glands shows that they express a unique cocktail of transcripts coding for known 
      venom toxins, including a diversity of enzymes and a probable paralytic neurotoxin 
      very similar to one described from spider venom. We screened a transcriptomic 
      library obtained from whole animals and identified a nontoxin paralog of the 
      remipede neurotoxin that is not expressed in the venom glands. This allowed us to 
      reconstruct its probable evolutionary origin and underlines the importance of 
      incorporating data derived from nonvenom gland tissue to elucidate the evolution of 
      candidate venom proteins. This first glimpse into the venom of a crustacean and 
      primitively aquatic arthropod reveals conspicuous differences from the venoms of 
      other predatory arthropods such as centipedes, scorpions, and spiders and 
      contributes valuable information for ultimately disentangling the many factors 
      shaping the biology and evolution of venoms and venomous species.

AB  - Spider venom contains a very valuable repertoire of natural resources to discover 
      novel components for molecular diversity analyses and therapeutic applications. In 
      this study, HWTX-XI toxins from the spider venom glands of Ornithoctonus huwena 
      which are Kunitz-type toxins (KTTs) and were directly cloned, analyzed and 
      functionally characterized. To date, the HWTX-XI superfamily consists of 38 members 
      deduced from 121 high-quality expressed sequence tags, which is the largest spider 
      KTT superfamily with significant molecular diversity mainly resulted from cDNA 
      tandem repeats as well as focal hypermutation. Among them, HW11c40 and HW11c50 may 
      be intermediate variants between native Kunitz toxins and sub-Kunitz toxins based on 
      evolutionary analyses. In order to elucidate their biological activities, 
      recombinant HW11c4, HW11c24, HW11c27 and HW11c39 were successfully expressed, 
      further purified and functionally characterized. Both HW11c4 and HW11c27 display 
      inhibitory activities against trypsin, chymotrypsin and kallikrein. Moreover, HW11c4 
      is also an inhibitor relatively specific for Kv1.1 channels. HW11c24 and HW11c39 are 
      found to be inactive on chymotrysin, trypsin, kallikrein, thrombin and ion channels. 
      These findings provide molecular evidence for toxin diversification of the HWTX-XI 
      superfamily and useful molecular templates of serine protease inhibitors and ion 
      channel blockers for the development of potentially clinical applications.

AB  - In past years, spider venoms have attracted increasing attention due to their 
      extraordinary chemical and pharmacological diversity. The recently popularized 
      proteomic method highly improved our ability to analyze the proteins in the venom. 
      However, the lack of information about isolated venom proteins sequences 
      dramatically limits the ability to confidently identify venom proteins. In the 
      present paper, the venom from Araneus ventricosus was analyzed using two 
      complementary approaches: 2-DE/Shotgun-LC-MS/MS coupled to MASCOT search and 
      2-DE/Shotgun-LC-MS/MS coupled to manual de novo sequencing followed by local venom 
      protein database (LVPD) search. The LVPD was constructed with toxin-like protein 
      sequences obtained from the analysis of cDNA library from A. ventricosus venom 
      glands. Our results indicate that a total of 130 toxin-like protein sequences were 
      unambiguously identified by manual de novo sequencing coupled to LVPD search, 
      accounting for 86.67% of all toxin-like proteins in LVPD. Thus manual de novo 
      sequencing coupled to LVPD search was proved an extremely effective approach for the 
      analysis of venom proteins. In addition, the approach displays impeccable advantage 
      in validating mutant positions of isoforms from the same toxin-like family. 
      Intriguingly, methyl esterifcation of glutamic acid was discovered for the first 
      time in animal venom proteins by manual de novo sequencing.

TI  - Insecticidal activity of a recombinant knottin peptide from Loxosceles intermedia 
      venom and recognition of these peptides as a conserved family in the genus.
PG  - 25-34
LID - 10.1111/imb.12268 [doi]
AB  - Loxosceles intermedia venom comprises a complex mixture of proteins, glycoproteins 
      and low molecular mass peptides that act synergistically to immobilize envenomed 
      prey. Analysis of a venom-gland transcriptome from L. intermedia revealed that 
      knottins, also known as inhibitor cystine knot peptides, are the most abundant class 
      of toxins expressed in this species. Knottin peptides contain a particular 
      arrangement of intramolecular disulphide bonds, and these peptides typically act 
      upon ion channels or receptors in the insect nervous system, triggering paralysis or 
      other lethal effects. Herein, we focused on a knottin peptide with 53 amino acid 
      residues from L. intermedia venom. The recombinant peptide, named U(2) 
      -sicaritoxin-Li1b (Li1b), was obtained by expression in the periplasm of Escherichia 
      coli. The recombinant peptide induced irreversible flaccid paralysis in sheep 
      blowflies. We screened for knottin-encoding sequences in total RNA extracts from two 
      other Loxosceles species, Loxosceles gaucho and Loxosceles laeta, which revealed 
      that knottin peptides constitute a conserved family of toxins in the Loxosceles 
      genus. The insecticidal activity of U(2) -SCTX-Li1b, together with the large number 
      of knottin peptides encoded in Loxosceles venom glands, suggests that studies of 
      these venoms might facilitate future biotechnological applications of these toxins.

LID - 2097
AB  - The golden orb-weaver spider Nephila clavipes, known for its sexual size dimorphism, 
      is abundant and widespread in the New World. The first annotated genome of 
      orb-weaver spiders, exploring N. clavipes, has recently been reported. The study, 
      focused primarily on the diversity of silk specific genes, shed light into the 
      complex evolutionary history of spiders. Furthermore, a robust transcriptome 
      analysis provided a massive resource for N. clavipes RNA survey. Here, I present 
      evidence of viral sequences corresponding to the first 10 extant virus species 
      associated to N. clavipes and indeed, nephilids. The putatively new species are 
      linked to ssRNA positive-strand viruses, such as Picornavirales, and to ssRNA 
      negative-strand and dsRNA viruses. In addition, I detected sequence data of new 
      strains of two recently reported arthropod viruses, which complemented and extended 
      the corresponding sequence references. The identified viruses appear to be complete, 
      potentially functional, and presenting the typical architecture and consistent viral 
      domains. The intrinsic nature of the detected sequences and their absence in the 
      recently generated genome assembly, suggest that they correspond to bona fide RNA 
      virus sequences. The available RNA data allowed for the first time to address a 
      tissue/organ specific analysis of virus loads/presence in spiders, suggesting a 
      complex spatial and differential distribution of the tentative viruses, encompassing 
      the spider brain and also silk and venom glands. Until recently, the virus landscape 
      associated to spiders remained elusive. The discovered viruses described here 
      provide only a fragmented glimpse of the potential magnitude of the Aranea 
      virosphere. Future studies should focus not only on complementing and expanding 
      these findings, but also on addressing the potential ecological role of these 
      viruses, which might influence the biology of these outstanding arthropod species.

TI  - A new theraphosid spider toxin causes early insect cell death by necrosis when 
      expressed in vitro during recombinant baculovirus infection.
PG  - e84404
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0084404 [doi]
LID - e84404
AB  - Baculoviruses are the most studied insect viruses in the world and are used for 
      biological control of agricultural and forest insect pests. They are also used as 
      versatile vectors for expression of heterologous proteins. One of the major problems 
      of their use as biopesticides is their slow speed to kill insects. Thus, to address 
      this shortcoming, insect-specific neurotoxins from arachnids have been introduced 
      into the baculovirus genome solely aiming to improve its virulence. In this work, an 
      insecticide-like toxin gene was obtained from a cDNA derived from the venom glands 
      of the theraphosid spider Brachypelma albiceps. The mature form of the peptide toxin 
      (called Ba3) has a high content of basic amino acid residues, potential for three 
      possible disulfide bonds, and a predicted three-stranded β-sheetDifferent 
      constructions of the gene were engineered for recombinant baculovirus Autographa 
      californica multiple nuclepolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) expression. Five different forms 
      of Ba3 were assessed; (1) the full-length sequence, (2) the pro-peptide and mature 
      region, (3) only the mature region, and the mature region fused to an (4) insect or 
      a (5) virus-derived signal peptide were inserted separately into the genome of the 
      baculovirus. All the recombinant viruses induced cell death by necrosis earlier in 
      infection relative to a control virus lacking the toxin gene. However, the 
      recombinant virus containing the mature portion of the toxin gene induced a faster 
      cell death than the other recombinants. We found that the toxin construct with the 
      signal peptide and/or pro-peptide regions delayed the necrosis phenotype. When 
      infected cells were subjected to ultrastructural analysis, the cells showed loss of 
      plasma membrane integrity and structural changes in mitochondria before death. Our 
      results suggest this use of baculovirus is a potential tool to help understand or to 
      identify the effect of insect-specific toxic peptides when produced during infection 
      of insect cells.

AB  - Due to some similarity of innate immunity between insects and mammals, the study of 
      the molecular mechanism of innate immunity in insects has become a focus of 
      research. However, the exact molecular and cellular basis of immune system in insect 
      remains poorly understood. Characterization of the transcriptomic response to Cd of 
      spider is an effective approach to understanding the innate immunity mechanisms. In 
      this study, we carried out transcriptome sequencing and gene expression analyses to 
      develop molecular resources for Pardosa pseudoannulata venom glands with and without 
      Cd treatments. A total of 92,778 assembled unigenes and 237 Cd stress-associated 
      differentially expressed genes between the Cd-treated and control groups were 
      obtained. Expression profile analysis demonstrated that immunity-related genes 
      involved in bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, leukocyte transendothelial 
      migration, platelet activation, apoptosis, phagosome, and Rap1 signaling pathway 
      were upregulated by Cd exposure, except the genes involved in PPAR signaling pathway 
      were downregulated. Our results provide the first comprehensive transcriptome 
      dataset of venom glands in P. pseudoannulata response to Cd, which is valuable for 
      throws light on the immunotoxicity mechanism of Cd, and the innate immunity 
      complexity.

TI  - Transcriptome Analysis to Understand the Toxicity of Latrodectus tredecimguttatus 
      Eggs.
LID - 10.3390/toxins8120378 [doi]
LID - 378
AB  - Latrodectus tredecimguttatus is a kind of highly venomous black widow spider, with 
      toxicity coming from not only venomous glands but also other parts of its body as 
      well as newborn spiderlings and eggs. Up to date, although L. tredecimguttatus eggs 
      have been demonstrated to be rich in proteinaceous toxins, there is no systematic 
      investigation on such active components at transcriptome level. In this study, we 
      performed a high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of L. tredecimguttatus eggs 
      with Illumina sequencing technology. As a result, 53,284 protein-coding unigenes 
      were identified, of which 14,185 unigenes produced significant hits in the available 
      databases, including 280 unigenes encoding proteins or peptides homologous to known 
      proteinaceous toxins. GO term and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of the 280 
      unigenes showed that 375 GO terms and 18 KEGG pathways were significantly enriched. 
      Functional analysis indicated that these unigene-coded toxins have the bioactivities 
      to degrade tissue proteins, inhibit ion channels, block neuromuscular transmission, 
      provoke anaphylaxis, induce apoptosis and hyperalgesia, etc. No known typical 
      proteinaceous toxins in L. tredecimguttatus venomous glands, such as latrotoxins, 
      were identified, suggesting that the eggs have a different toxicity mechanism from 
      that of the venom. Our present transcriptome analysis not only helps to reveal the 
      gene expression profile and toxicity mechanism of the L. tredecimguttatus eggs, but 
      also provides references for the further related researches.

TI  - Structure of the yellow sac spider Cheiracanthium punctorium genes provides clues to 
      evolution of insecticidal two-domain knottin toxins.
PG  - 527-38
LID - 10.1111/imb.12097 [doi]
AB  - Yellow sac spiders (Cheiracanthium punctorium, family Miturgidae) are unique in 
      terms of venom composition, because, as we show here, two-domain toxins have 
      replaced the usual one-domain peptides as the major constituents. We report the 
      structure of the two-domain Che. punctorium toxins (CpTx), along with the 
      corresponding cDNA and genomic DNA sequences. At least three groups of insecticidal 
      CpTx were identified, each consisting of several members. Unlike many cone snail and 
      snake toxins, accelerated evolution is not typical of cptx genes, which instead 
      appear to be under the pressure of purifying selection. Both CpTx modules present 
      the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK), or knottin signature; however, the sequence 
      similarity between the domains is low. Conversely, notable similarity was found 
      between separate domains of CpTx and one-domain toxins from spiders of the Lycosidae 
      family. The observed chimerism is a landmark of exon shuffling events, but in 
      contrast to many families of multidomain protein genes no introns were found in the 
      cptx genes. Considering the possible scenarios, we suggest that an early 
      transcription-mediated fusion event between two related one-domain toxin genes led 
      to the emergence of a primordial cptx-like sequence. We conclude that evolution of 
      toxin variability in spiders appears to be quite different from other venomous 
      animals.

TI  - Selective olfactory attention of a specialised predator to intraspecific chemical 
      signals of its prey.
PG  - 597-605
LID - 10.1007/s00114-012-0938-9 [doi]
AB  - Prey-specialised predators have evolved specific cognitive adaptations that increase 
      their prey searching efficiency. In particular, when the prey is social, selection 
      probably favours the use of prey intraspecific chemical signals by predatory 
      arthropods. Using a specialised ant-eating zodariid spider, Zodarion rubidum, which 
      is known to prey on several ant species and possesses capture and venom adaptations 
      more effective on Formicinae ants, we tested its ability to recognise chemical cues 
      produced by several ant species. Using an olfactometer, we tested the response of Z. 
      rubidum towards air with chemical cues from six different ant species: Camponotus 
      ligniperda, Lasius platythorax and Formica rufibarbis (all Formicinae); and Messor 
      structor, Myrmica scabrinodis and Tetramorium caespitum (all Myrmicinae). Z. rubidum 
      was attracted to air carrying chemical cues only from F. rufibarbis and L. 
      platythorax. Then, we identified that the spiders were attracted to airborne cues 
      coming from the F. rufibarbis gaster and Dufour's gland, in particular. Finally, we 
      found that among several synthetic blends, the decyl acetate and undecane mixture 
      produced significant attraction of spiders. These chemicals are produced only by 
      three Formicine genera. Furthermore, we investigated the role of these chemical cues 
      in the communication of F. rufibarbis and found that this blend reduces their 
      movement. This study demonstrates the chemical cognitive capacity of Z. rubidum to 
      locate its ant prey using chemical signals produced by the ants. The innate capacity 
      of Z. rubidum to olfactory detect different ant species is narrow, as it includes 
      only two ant genera, confirming trophic specialisation at lower than subfamily 
      level. The olfactory cue detected by Zodarion spiders is probably a component of the 
      recruitment or trail pheromone.

TI  - A sodium channel inhibitor ISTX-I with a novel structure provides a new hint at the 
      evolutionary link between two toxin folds.
PG  - 29691
LID - 10.1038/srep29691 [doi]
LID - 29691
AB  - Members of arachnida, such as spiders and scorpions, commonly produce venom with 
      specialized venom glands, paralyzing their prey with neurotoxins that specifically 
      target ion channels. Two well-studied motifs, the disulfide-directed hairpin (DDH) 
      and the inhibitor cystine knot motif (ICK), are both found in scorpion and spider 
      toxins. As arachnids, ticks inject a neurotoxin-containing cocktail from their 
      salivary glands into the host to acquire a blood meal, but peptide toxins acting on 
      ion channels have not been observed in ticks. Here, a new neurotoxin (ISTX-I) that 
      acts on sodium channels was identified from the hard tick Ixodes scapularis and 
      characterized. ISTX-I exhibits a potent inhibitory function with an IC50 of 1.6 μM 
      for sodium channel Nav1.7 but not other sodium channel subtypes. ISTX-I adopts a 
      novel structural fold and is distinct from the canonical ICK motif. Analysis of the 
      ISTX-I, DDH and ICK motifs reveals that the new ISTX-I motif might be an 
      intermediate scaffold between DDH and ICK, and ISTX-I is a clue to the evolutionary 
      link between the DDH and ICK motifs. These results provide a glimpse into the 
      convergent evolution of neurotoxins from predatory and blood-sucking arthropods.
