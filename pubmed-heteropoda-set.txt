TI  - Molecular diversity and evolutionary trends of cysteine-rich peptides from the venom 
      glands of Chinese spider Heteropoda venatoria.

AB  - Heteropoda venatoria in the family Sparassidae is highly valued in pantropical 
      countries because the species feed on domestic insect pests. Unlike most other 
      species of Araneomorphae, H. venatoria uses the great speed and strong chelicerae 
      (mouthparts) with toxin glands to capture the insects instead of its web. Therefore, 
      H. venatoria provides unique opportunities for venom evolution research. The venom 
      of H. venatoria was explored by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem 
      time-of-flight and analyzing expressed sequence tags. The 154 sequences coding 
      cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs) revealed 24 families based on the phylogenetic 
      analyses of precursors and cysteine frameworks in the putative mature regions. 
      Intriguingly, four kinds of motifs are first described in spider venom. Furthermore, 
      combining the diverse CRPs of H. venatoria with previous spider venom peptidomics 
      data, the structures of precursors and the patterns of cysteine frameworks were 
      analyzed. This work revealed the dynamic evolutionary trends of venom CRPs in H. 
      venatoria: the precursor has evolved an extended mature peptide with more cysteines, 
      and a diminished or even vanished propeptides between the signal and mature 
      peptides; and the CRPs evolved by multiple duplications of an ancestral ICK gene as 
      well as recruitments of non-toxin genes.

AB  - Heteropoda venatoria is a venomous spider species distributed worldwide and has a 
      characteristic habit of feeding on insects. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
      chromatography and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass 
      spectrometry analyses revealed that H. venatoria venom contains hundreds of peptides 
      with a predominant molecular weights of 3000-5000 Da. Intra-abdominal injection of 
      the venom had severe toxic effects on cockroaches and caused death at higher 
      concentrations. The LD(50) was 28.18 μg/g of body weight in the cockroach. It was 
      found that the venom had potent inhibitory effect on voltage-gated sodium channels 
      (VGSCs) in Periplaneta americana cockroach dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons with 
      an IC(50) values of 6.25 ± 0.02 μg/mL. However, 100 μg/mL venom only partially 
      blocked VGSC currents in rat dorsal root ganglion cells, a much lower inhibitory 
      effect than that on DUM VGSCs. Our results indicate that the venom of H. venatoria 
      contains diverse neurotoxins that might become new leads for bioinsecticides.

TI  - Purification and Characterization of a Novel Insecticidal Toxin, μ-sparatoxin-Hv2, 
      from the Venom of the Spider Heteropoda venatoria.
LID - 10.3390/toxins10060233 [doi]
LID - 233
AB  - The venom of the spider Heteropoda venatoria produced lethal effect to cockroaches 
      as reported in our previous study, and could be a resource for naturally-occurring 
      insecticides. The present study characterized a novel cockroach voltage-gated sodium 
      channels (Na(V)s) antagonist, μ-sparatoxin-Hv2 (μ-SPRTX-Hv2 for short), from this 
      venom. μ-SPRTX-Hv2 is composed of 37 amino acids and contains six conserved 
      cysteines. We synthesized the toxin by using the chemical synthesis method. The 
      toxin was lethal to cockroaches when intraperitoneally injected, with a LD(50) value 
      of 2.8 nmol/g of body weight. Electrophysiological data showed that the toxin 
      potently blocked Na(V)s in cockroach dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons, with an 
      IC(50) of 833.7 ± 132.2 nM, but it hardly affected the DUM voltage-gated potassium 
      channels (K(V)s) and the DUM high-voltage-activated calcium channels (HVA Ca(V)s). 
      The toxin also did not affect Na(V)s, HVA Ca(V)s, and Kvs in rat dorsal root 
      ganglion (DRG) neurons, as well as Na(V) subtypes Na(V)1.3⁻1.5, Na(V)1.7, and 
      Na(V)1.8. No envenomation symptoms were observed when μ-SPRTX-Hv2 was 
      intraperitoneally injected into mouse at the dose of 7.0 μg/g. In summary, 
      μ-SPRTX-Hv2 is a novel insecticidal toxin from H. venatoria venom. It might exhibit 
      its effect by blocking the insect Na(V)s and is a candidate for developing 
      bioinsecticide.

TI  - Newly Discovered Action of HpTx3 from Venom of Heteropoda venatoria on Na(v)1.7 and 
      Its Pharmacological Implications in Analgesia.
LID - 10.3390/toxins11120680 [doi]
LID - 680
AB  - It has been reported that Heteropodatoxin3 (HpTx3), a peptidic neurotoxin purified 
      from the venom of the spider species Heteropoda venatoria, could inhibit K(v)4.2 
      channels. Our present study newly found that HpTx3 also has potent and selective 
      inhibitory action on Na(v)1.7, with an IC(50) of 135.61 ± 12.98 nM. Without effect 
      on the current-voltage (I-V) relationship of Na(v)1.7, HpTx3 made minor alternation 
      in the voltage-dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation of Na(v)1.7 
      (4.15 mV and 7.29 mV, respectively) by interacting with the extracellular S3-S4 loop 
      (S3b-S4 sequence) in domain II and the domain IV of the Na(v) channel subtype, 
      showing the characteristics of both pore blocker and gate modifier toxin. During the 
      interaction of HpTx3 with the S3b-S4 sequence of Na(v)1.7, the amino acid residue D 
      in the sequence played a key role. When administered intraperitoneally or 
      intramuscularly, HpTx3 displayed potent analgesic activity in a dose-dependent 
      manner in different mouse pain models induced by formalin, acetic acid, complete 
      Freund's adjuvant, hot plate, or spared nerve injury, demonstrating that acute, 
      inflammatory, and neuropathic pains were all effectively inhibited by the toxin. In 
      most cases HpTx3 at doses of ≥ 1mg/kg could produce the analgesic effect comparable 
      to that of 1 mg/kg morphine. These results suggest that HpTx3 not only can be used 
      as a molecular probe to investigate ion channel function and pain mechanism, but 
      also has potential in the development of the drugs that treat the Na(v)1.7 
      channel-related pain.

PG  - 125-33
LID - 10.1124/mol.109.055657 [doi]
AB  - Heteropoda venatoria toxin 2 (HpTx2) is an inhibitor cystine knot (ICK)-gating 
      modifier toxin that selectively inhibits Kv4 channels. To characterize the molecular 
      determinants of interaction, we performed alanine scanning of the Kv4.3 S3b region. 
      HpTx2-Kv4.3 interaction had an apparent K(d) value of 2.3 microM. Two alanine 
      mutants in Kv4.3 increased K(d) values to 6.4 microM for V276A and 25 microM for 
      L275A. Simultaneous mutation of both amino acids to alanine nearly eliminated toxin 
      interaction. Unlike Hanatoxin and other well characterized ICK toxins, HpTx2 binding 
      does not require a charged amino acid for interaction. To determine whether the 
      identity of the S3b binding site amino acids altered HpTx2 specificity, we 
      constructed Kv4.3 [LV275IF]. This mutation decreased the K(d) value to 0.54 microM, 
      suggesting that the hydrophobic character of the putative binding site is the most 
      important property for interaction with HpTx2. One mutant, N280A, caused stronger 
      interaction of HpTx2 with Kv4.3; the K(d) value for Kv4.3 [N280A] was 0.26 microM. 
      To understand Kv4.3-based transient outward currents in native tissues, we tested 
      the affinity of HpTx2 for Kv4.3 coexpressed with KChIP2b. The toxin's K(d) value for 
      Kv4.3 + KChIP2b was 0.95 microM. KChIP2b stabilizes the closed state of Kv4.3, 
      suggesting that the increased toxin affinity is due to increased stabilization of 
      the closed state. These data show that HpTx2 binding to Kv4.3 has aspects in common 
      with other ICK gating modifier toxins but that the interventions that increase toxin 
      affinity suggest flexibility toward channel binding that belies its unusual 
      specificity for Kv4 channels.

TI  - Solution structure of hpTX2, a toxin from Heteropoda venatoria spider that blocks 
      Kv4.2 potassium channel.
PG  - 2059-67
AB  - HpTX2 is a toxin from the venom of Heteropoda venatoria spider that has been 
      demonstrated to bind on Kv4.2 potassium channel. We have determined the solution 
      structure of recombinant HpTX2 by use of conventional two-dimensional NMR techniques 
      followed by distance-geometry and molecular dynamics. The calculated structure 
      belongs to the Inhibitory Cystin Knot structural family that consists in a compact 
      disulfide-bonded core, from which four loops emerge. A poorly defined two-stranded 
      antiparallel beta-sheet (residues 20-23 and 25-28) is detected. Analysis of the 
      electrostatic charge anisotropy allows us to propose a functional map of HpTX2 
      different from the one described for kappa-conotoxin PVIIA, but strongly related to 
      the one of charybdotoxin. The orientation of the dipole moment of HpTX2 emerges 
      through K27 which could therefore be the critical lysine residue. Close to this 
      lysine are a second basic residue, R23, an aromatic cluster (F7, W25, W30) and an 
      hydrophobic side chain (L24). The high density in aromatic side chains of the 
      putative functional surface as well as the lack of an asparagine is proposed to be 
      the structural basis of the specificity of HpTX2 toward Kv4.2 channel.

TI  - A new assay for the detection of Loxosceles species (brown recluse) spider venom.
PG  - 469-74
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Dermal lesions from unrelated arthropod species and medical causes 
      appear similar to Loxosceles species (brown recluse spider) bites. This may result 
      in delayed diagnosis and treatment. We developed a sensitive Loxosceles species 
      venom enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and characterized the specificity of 
      the assay by evaluating antigenic cross-reactivity from a variety of North American 
      arthropod venoms. METHODS: North American arthropod (14 spiders, 2 scorpions, and 1 
      bee) venoms were studied. Three venom amounts (diluted in 100 microL of ELISA 
      buffer) were assayed: 16,000 ng, 2,000 ng, and 40 ng. The latter quantity was 
      selected because this is the observed maximum amount of venom we detect when 
      inoculating dermis with amounts likely to be deposited by a spider bite. The larger 
      venom amounts are overwhelming quantities designed to test the limits of the assay 
      for arthropod venom cross-reactivity. Similar amounts of Loxosceles species venom 
      and bovine albumin served as positive and negative controls, respectively. RESULTS: 
      At the lowest amount of venom tested (40 ng), the ELISA detected only the Loxosceles 
      species positive control. When 2,000 ng was assayed, only Scytodes fusca and 
      Kukulcania hibernalis arachnid venoms (in addition to Loxosceles species) 
      cross-reacted to the assay. Finally, at 16,000 ng, the ELISA assay modestly detected 
      Diguetia canities, Heteropoda venatoria, Tegenaria agrestis, Plectreurys tristes, 
      Dolomedes tenebrosus, and Hadrurus arizonensis arachnid venoms. CONCLUSION: 
      Cross-reactivity was observed in 8 of 17 North American arthropod venoms when large 
      venom amounts were assayed with a Loxosceles species ELISA. By using a relevant 
      quantity of venom, 40 ng, the assay was specific for Loxosceles species venom. The 
      venom specificity of the ELISA may allow clinical application in Loxosceles species 
      endemic regions of North America.

TI  - Heteropoda toxin 2 interaction with Kv4.3 and Kv4.1 reveals differences in gating 
      modification.
PG  - 345-55
LID - 10.1124/mol.111.072405 [doi]
AB  - Kv4 (Shal) potassium channels are responsible for the transient outward K(+) 
      currents in mammalian hearts and central nervous systems. Heteropoda toxin 2 (HpTx2) 
      is an inhibitor cysteine knot peptide toxin specific for Kv4 channels that inhibits 
      gating of Kv4.3 in the voltage-dependent manner typical for this type of toxin. 
      HpTx2 interacts with four independent binding sites containing two conserved 
      hydrophobic amino acids in the S3b transmembrane segments of Kv4.3 and the closely 
      related Kv4.1. Despite these similarities, HpTx2 interaction with Kv4.1 is 
      considerably less voltage-dependent, has smaller shifts in the voltage-dependences 
      of conductance and steady-state inactivation, and a 3-fold higher K(d) value. 
      Swapping four nonconserved amino acids in S3b between the two channels exchanges the 
      phenotypic response to HpTx2. To understand these differences in gating 
      modification, we constructed Markov models of Kv4.3 and Kv4.1 activation gating in 
      the presence of HpTx2. Both models feature a series of voltage-dependent steps 
      leading to a final voltage-independent transition to the open state and closely 
      replicate the experimental data. Interaction with HpTx2 increases the energy barrier 
      for channel opening by slowing activation and accelerating deactivation. The greater 
      degree of voltage-dependence in Kv4.3 occurs because it is the voltage-dependent 
      transitions that are most affected by HpTx2; in contrast, it is the 
      voltage-independent step in Kv4.1 that is most affected by the presence of toxin. 
      These data demonstrate the basis for subtype-specificity of HpTx2 and point the way 
      to a general model of gating modifier toxin interaction with voltage-gated ion 
      channels.

TI  - Characterization of slowly inactivating KV{alpha} current in rabbit pulmonary 
      neuroepithelial bodies: effects of hypoxia and nicotine.
PG  - L892-902
AB  - Pulmonary neuroepithelial bodies (NEB) form innervated cell clusters that express 
      voltage-activated currents and function as airway O(2) sensors. We investigated 
      A-type K(+) currents in NEB cells using neonatal rabbit lung slice preparation. The 
      whole cell K(+) current was slowly inactivating with activation threshold of 
      approximately -30 mV. This current was blocked approximately 27% by blood-depressing 
      substance I (BDS-I; 3 microM), a selective blocker of Kv3.4 subunit, and reduced 
      approximately 20% by tetraethylammonium (TEA; 100 microM). The BDS-I-sensitive 
      component had an average peak value of 189 +/- 14 pA and showed fast inactivation 
      kinetics that could be fitted by one-component exponential function with a time 
      constant of (tau1) 77 +/- 10 ms. This Kv slowly inactivating current was also 
      blocked by heteropodatoxin-2 (HpTx-2; 0.2 microM), a blocker of Kv4 subunit. The 
      HpTx-2-sensitive current had an average peak value of 234 +/- 23 pA with a time 
      constant (tau) 82 +/- 11 ms. Hypoxia (Po(2) = 15-20 mmHg) inhibited the slowly 
      inactivating K(+) current by approximately 47%, during voltage steps from -30 to +30 
      mV, and no further inhibition occurred when TEA was combined with hypoxia. Nicotine 
      at concentrations of 50 and 100 microM suppressed the slowly inactivating K(+) 
      current by approximately 24 and approximately 40%, respectively. This suppression 
      was not reversed by mecamylamine suggesting a direct effect of nicotine on these 
      K(+) channels. In situ hybridization experiments detected expression of mRNAs for 
      Kv3.4 and Kv4.3 subunits, while double-label immunofluorescence confirmed membrane 
      localization of respective channel proteins in NEB cells. These studies suggest that 
      the hypoxia-sensitive current in NEB cells is carried by slowly inactivating A-type 
      K(+) channels, which underlie their oxygen-sensitive potassium currents, and that 
      exposure to nicotine may directly affect their function, contributing to 
      smoking-related lung disease.

      Cardiomyocytes.
PG  - e0133274

LID - e0133274
AB  - Gradients of the fast transient outward K+ current (Ito,f) contribute to 
      heterogeneity of ventricular repolarization in a number of species. Cardiac Ito,f 
      levels and gradients change notably with heart disease. Human cardiac Ito,f appears 
      to be encoded by the Kv4.3 pore-forming α-subunit plus the auxiliary KChIP2 
      β-subunit while mouse cardiac Ito,f requires Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 α-subunits plus KChIP2. 
      Regional differences in cardiac Ito,f are associated with expression differences in 
      Kv4.2 and KChIP2. Although Ito,f was reported to be absent in mouse ventricular 
      cardiomyocytes lacking the Kv4.2 gene (Kv4.2-/-) when short depolarizing voltage 
      pulses were used to activate voltage-gated K+ currents, in the present study, we 
      showed that the use of long depolarization steps revealed a 
      heteropodatoxin-sensitive Ito,f (at ~40% of the wild-type levels). 
      Immunohistological studies further demonstrated membrane expression of Kv4.3 in 
      Kv4.2-/- cardiomyocytes. Transmural Ito,f gradients across the left ventricular wall 
      were reduced by ~3.5-fold in Kv4.2-/- heart, compared to wild-type. The Ito,f 
      gradient in Kv4.2-/- hearts was associated with gradients in KChIP2 mRNA expression 
      while in wild-type there was also a gradient in Kv4.2 expression. In conclusion, we 
      found that Kv4.3-based Ito,f exists in the absence of Kv4.2, although with a reduced 
      transmural gradient. Kv4.2-/- mice may be a useful animal model for studying 
      Kv4.3-based Ito,f as observed in humans.

TI  - Effect of gating modifier toxins on membrane thickness: implications for toxin 
      effect on gramicidin and mechanosensitive channels.
PG  - 456-71
LID - 10.3390/toxins5020456 [doi]
AB  - Various gating modifier toxins partition into membranes and interfere with the 
      gating mechanisms of biological ion channels. For example, GsMTx4 potentiates 
      gramicidin and several bacterial mechanosensitive channels whose gating kinetics are 
      sensitive to mechanical properties of the membrane, whereas binding of HpTx2 shifts 
      the voltage-activity curve of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv4.2 to the 
      right. The detailed process by which the toxin partitions into membranes has been 
      difficult to probe using molecular dynamics due to the limited time scale 
      accessible. Here we develop a protocol that allows the spontaneous assembly of a 
      polypeptide toxin into membranes in atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of tens 
      of nanoseconds. The protocol is applied to GsMTx4 and HpTx2. Both toxins, released 
      in water at the start of the simulation, spontaneously bind into the lipid bilayer 
      within 50 ns, with their hydrophobic patch penetrated into the bilayer beyond the 
      phosphate groups of the lipids. It is found that the bilayer is about 2 Å thinner 
      upon the binding of a GsMTx4 monomer. Such a thinning effect of GsMTx4 on membranes 
      may explain its potentiation effect on gramicidin and mechanosensitive channels.
